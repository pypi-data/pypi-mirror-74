        =======
        
        A library for converting Django forms to json schema endpoints
        
        ## Usage
        
        First install with `pip install unrest_schema` and then register any form:
        
        ``` python
        from django import forms
        from unrest_schema import register
        
        from myapp.models import MyModel
        
        @register
        class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
            class Meta:
                model = MyModel
                fields = ('field1', ...)
        ```
        
        Then, in your urls add a the urls for unrest_schema
        
        ``` python
        from django.urls import include
        
        urlpatterns = [
            ..., #other url patterns
            re_path('', include('unrest_schema.urls')),
        ]
        ```
        
        Now visit `/api/schema/MyModelForm/` in a browser to get the json representation of MyModelForm. Additionally you can post to `/api/schema/MyModelForm/` to create a new MyModel instance or `/api/schema/MyModelForm/1/` to modify the MyModel instance with `id=1`.
