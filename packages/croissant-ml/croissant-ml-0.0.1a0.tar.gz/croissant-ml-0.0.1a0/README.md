# croissant
The goal of this repo is to create the infrastructure capable of
creating a classifier to classify segmented ROIs in two photon
microscopy video into Cell/Not Cell. It is currently in active
development. The community is welcome to use this repository as an
infrastructure to create classifiers for two photon microscopy video.

## Level of support
We are not currently supporting this code, but simply releasing it to
the community AS IS. We are not able to provide any guarantees of
support. The community may submit issues, but you should not expect an
active response.

## Contributing
This tool is important for internal use at the Allen Institute. Because
it's designed for internal needs, we are not anticipating external
contributions. Pull requests may not be accepted if they conflict with
our existing plans.
