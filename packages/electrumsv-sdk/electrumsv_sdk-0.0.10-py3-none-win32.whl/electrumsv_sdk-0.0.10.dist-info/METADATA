ElectrumSV Software Development Kit
===================================

  Licence: The Open BSV License
  Maintainers: Roger Taylor, AustEcon
  Project Lead: Roger Taylor
  Language: Python (>=3.7)
  Homepage: https://electrumsv.io/

Overview
========

This project provides a consolidated set of resources that together can allow a developer, whether
working on ElectrumSV directly or on an application based on ElectrumSV, to develop, run and test
while offline.

Instructions
============
This project is still in early stages. However, to test it out
in this early stage of development you can do
(from the top-level directory of this repository)::

    > pip install -e .

(the '-e' flag is for installing in development 'editable' mode).
Now you have global access to a script called 'electrumsv-sdk.exe' from
any console window. Now do::

    > electrumsv-sdk

Which will run the default 'full-stack' of:

- electrumsv (in daemon mode)
- electrumx server
- RegTest bitcoin daemon (as a background process)

**Ctrl + C** will terminate the servers cleanly and close the newly opened console windows.

For help::

    > electrumsv-sdk --help

Which (on 11/07/2020) will show::

    ElectrumSV Software Development Kit
    -Python version 3.8.4-64bit

    usage: electrumsv-sdk [-h] [--full-stack] [--node] [--ex-node] [--esv-ex-node] [--esv-idx-node]
                          [--extapp EXTAPP_PATH]
                          {electrumsv,electrumx,electrumsv_indexer,electrumsv_node} ...

    codes:
    ------
    - esv=electrumsv daemon
    - ex=electrumx server
    - node=electrumsv-node
    - idx=electrumsv-indexer (with pushdata-centric API)
    - full-stack=defaults to 'esv-ex-node' as these are the default run-time
    dependencies of electrumsv as of July 2020.

    examples:
    > electrumsv-sdk --full-stack or
    > electrumsv-sdk --esv-ex-node
    will run electrumsv + electrumx + electrumsv-node (both have equivalent effect)

    > electrumsv-sdk --esv-idx-node
    will run electrumsv + electrumsv-indexer + electrumsv-node

    dependencies are installed on-demand at run-time

    specify which local or remote (git repo) and branch for each component with the
    subcommands below. ('repo' can take the form:
    - repo=https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv.git or
    - repo=G:/electrumsv for a local dev repo)

    > electrumsv-sdk --full-stack electrumsv repo=G:/electrumsv branch=develop

    all arguments are optional

    positional arguments:
      {electrumsv,electrumx,electrumsv_indexer,electrumsv_node}
                            subcommand
        electrumsv          specify repo and branch
        electrumx           specify repo and branch
        electrumsv_indexer  specify repo and branch
        electrumsv_node     specify repo and branch

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --full-stack
      --node
      --ex-node
      --esv-ex-node
      --esv-idx-node
      --extapp EXTAPP_PATH  path to 3rd party applications. The 'extapp' flag can be specified multiple times. For electrumsv 'daemon apps' please see electrumsv subcommand help menu

Mode (which servers to run)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first, "--" prefixed argument sets the "mode" of operation
(in other words which servers are required).
Only one mode can be specified.
The default is to run with ``--full-stack`` if no arguments are parsed which runs:

1) electrumsv daemon
2) electrumx
3) bitcoin daemon

But in other cases you may wish to run the electrumsv **GUI** instead
(or your own 3rd party application that only requires these two
dependencies). So you may elect to use the ``--ex-node`` flag to only run:

1) electrumx
2) bitcoin daemon.

Extension 3rd party Apps (Not implemented yet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The second, "--" prefixed, optional argument is ``--extapp`` which will add
to the above list your own 3rd party server to be launched and terminated
alongside the others. This argument can be specified multiple times like::

    > electrumsv-sdk --extapp pathtoapp1 --extapp pathtoapp2

NOTE: must be an executable (which allows use to support any programming language)
a good example usecase for this is to run a localhost node.js block
explorer alongside this RegTest stack.

Subcommands (server-specific configurations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the initial "--" prefixed, top-level arguments (that always come first),
what follows is optional server-specific configurations for:

1) electrumsv
2) electrumx
3) electrumsv_node
4) electrumsv_indexer (in development)

The syntax is to specify the name of the server followed by "-" prefixed
optional arguments like this::

    > electrumsv-sdk electrumsv -repo=https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv.git -branch=master


**(Remote repo):** A 'repo' beginning with "https://" is automatically installed to the 'sdk_depends/'
directory as part of this SDK - this could be a forked repository or the official repo
(which is the default anyway).

**(Local repo):** If there is no such "https://" prefix to the 'repo' argument, it is assumed to be
a filesystem path to a local development repository and so no installation or
``git pull`` is attempted - it becomes the developers responsibility for the correct
functioning of this server. But it will be launched and terminated in the usual way.
