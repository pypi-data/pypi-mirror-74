    """Calculate Zwicker-loudness for stationary signals

    Calculate the acoustic loudness according to Zwicker method for
    stationary signals.
    Normatice reference:
        ISO 532:1975 (method B)
        DIN 45631:1991
        ISO 532-1:2017 (method 1)
    The code is based on BASIC program published in "Program for
    calculating loudness according to DIN 45631 (ISO 532B)", E.Zwicker
    and H.Fastl, J.A.S.J (E) 12, 1 (1991). 
    Note that for reasons of normative continuity, as defined in the
    preceeding standards, the method is in accordance with 
    ISO 226:1987 equal loudness contours (instead of ISO 226:2003)

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec_third : numpy.ndarray
        A third octave band spectrum [dB ref. 2e-5 Pa]
    third_axis : numpy.ndarray
        Normalized center frequency of third octave bands [Hz]
    field_type : str
        Type of soundfield correspondin to spec_third ("free" by 
        default or "diffuse")

    Outputs
    -------
    N : float
        Calculated loudness [sones]
    N_specific : numpy.ndarray
        Specific loudness [sones/bark]
    bark_axis : numpy.ndarray
        Corresponding bark axis
