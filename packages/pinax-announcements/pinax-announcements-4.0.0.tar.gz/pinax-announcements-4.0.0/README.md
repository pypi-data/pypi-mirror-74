## pinax-announcements

### Overview

`pinax-announcements` is a well tested, documented, and proven solution
for any site wanting announcements for its users.

#### Features

Announcements have title and content, with options for filtering their display:

* `site_wide` - True or False
* `members_only` - True or False
* `publish_start` - date/time or none
* `publish_end` - date/time or none

`pinax-announcements` has three options for dismissing an announcement:

* `DISMISSAL_NO` - always visible
* `DISMISSAL_SESSION` - dismiss for the session
* `DISMISSAL_PERMANENT` - dismiss forever

#### Supported Django and Python Versions

Django / Python | 3.6 | 3.7 | 3.8
--------------- | --- | --- | ---  
2.2  |  *  |  *  |  *   
3.0  |  *  |  *  |  *  


## Documentation

### Installation

To install pinax-announcements:

```shell
    $ pip install pinax-announcements
```

Add `pinax.announcements` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # other apps
        "pinax.announcements",
    ]
```

Optionally, if you want someone other than staff to manage announcements,
enable this authentication backend:

```python
    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        # other backends
        "pinax.announcements.auth_backends.AnnouncementPermissionsBackend",
    ]
```

then enable permission `"announcements.can_manage"` for these managers.

Add `pinax.announcements.urls` to your project urlpatterns:

```python
    urlpatterns = [
        # other urls
        url(r"^announcements/", include("pinax.announcements.urls", namespace="pinax_announcements")),
    ]
```

### Usage

#### Displaying Announcements

First load the template tags:

```django
    {% load pinax_announcements_tags %}
```

Then fetch announcements with the `announcements` template tag:

```django
    <h3>Announcements</h3>

    {% announcements as announcement_list %}

    {% if announcement_list %}
        <div class="announcements">
            {% for announcement in announcement_list %}
                <div class="announcement">
                    <strong>{{ announcement.title }}</strong><br />
                    {{ announcement.content }}
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
```

If your announcement content is too large for viewing inline
then show a link to a detail view:

```django
    <a href="{{ announcement.get_absolute_url }}">Read more...</a>
```

See [Template Tags](#template-tags) for detail on pinax-announcements template tags.

#### Dismissing Announcements

Add this markup to show a "Dismiss" link if available:

```django
    {% if announcement.dismiss_url %}
        <form class="form ajax" data-replace-closest=".announcement" action="{{ announcement.dismiss_url }}" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <button class="btn btn-default">Clear</button>
        </form>
    {% endif %}
```

##### Dismissal with Eldarion AJAX

The anchor markup shown above and the announcement dismissal view both conform
to an `AJAX` response that [eldarion-ajax](https://github.com/eldarion/eldarion-ajax) understands.
Furthermore, the templates that ship with this project will work
seemlessly with `eldarion-ajax`. Include the
eldarion-ajax.min.js Javascript package in your base template:

```django
    {% load staticfiles %}
    <script src="{% static "js/eldarion-ajax.min.js" %}"></script>
```

and include `eldarion-ajax` in your site JavaScript:

```javascript
    require('eldarion-ajax');
```

This of course is optional. You can roll your own JavaScript handling as
the view also returns data in addition to rendered HTML. Furthermore, if
you don't want `ajax` at all the view will handle a regular `POST` and
perform a redirect.

### Signals

#### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_created

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is created.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the created `Announcement` instance.
Sender is the newly created Announcement instance.

#### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_updated

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is updated.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the updated `Announcement` instance.
Sender is the newly updated Announcement instance.

#### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_deleted

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is deleted.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the deleted `Announcement` instance.
Sender is `None`.

### Template Tags

#### announcements

Filters announcements by `publish_start` and `publish_end` date range, including
all with no `publish_end` value.
Returns announcements matching `site_wide == True` and `members_only == False`,
and which are not dismissed.

```django
    {% announcements as announcement_list %}
    {% for announcement in announcement_list %}
        <div>
            {{ announcement.title }}<br />
            {{ announcement.content }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
```

### Templates

Default templates are provided by the `pinax-templates` app in the
[announcements](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates/tree/master/pinax/templates/templates/pinax/announcements)
section of that project.

Reference pinax-templates
[installation instructions](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates/blob/master/README.md#installation)
to include these templates in your project.

View live `pinax-templates` examples and source at [Pinax Templates](https://templates.pinaxproject.com/pinax-announcements/)!

#### Customizing Templates

Override the default `pinax-templates` templates by copying them into your project
subdirectory `pinax/announcements/` on the template path and modifying as needed.

For example if your project doesn't use Bootstrap, copy the desired templates
then remove Bootstrap and Font Awesome class names from your copies.
Remove class references like `class="btn btn-success"` and `class="icon icon-pencil"` as well as
`bootstrap` from the `{% load i18n bootstrap %}` statement.
Since `bootstrap` template tags and filters are no longer loaded, you'll also need to update
`{{ form|bootstrap }}` to `{{ form }}` since the "bootstrap" filter is no longer available.

#### `announcement_confirm_delete.html`

#### `announcement_detail.html`

#### `announcement_form.html`

#### `announcement_list.html`

#### `base.html`
