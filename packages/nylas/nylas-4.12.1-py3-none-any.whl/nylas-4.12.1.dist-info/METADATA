Python bindings for the Nylas REST API. https://www.nylas.com/docs

The Nylas APIs power applications with email, calendar, and contacts CRUD and bi-directional sync from any inbox in the world.

Nylas is compatible with 100% of email service providers, so you only have to integrate once.
No more headaches building unique integrations against archaic and outdated IMAP and SMTP protocols.
