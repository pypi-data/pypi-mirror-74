    """The ``ViewPanel`` class is the base-class for all *FSLeyes views*.

    A ``ViewPanel`` displays some sort of view of the overlays in an
    :class:`.OverlayList`. The settings for a ``ViewPanel`` are defined by a
    :class:`.DisplayContext` instance.


    **Panels and controls**


    A ``ViewPanel`` class uses a ``wx.lib.agw.aui.AuiManager`` to lay out its
    children. A ``ViewPanel`` has one central panel, which contains the
    primary view; and may have one or more secondary panels, which contain
    *controls* - see the :mod:`.controls` package. The centre panel can be set
    via the :meth:`centrePanel` property, and secondary panels can be
    added/removed to/from with the :meth:`togglePanel` method. The current
    state of a secondary panel (i.e. whether one is open or not) can be
    queried with the :meth:`isPanelOpen` method, and existing secondary panels
    can be accessed via the :meth:`getPanel` method.  Secondary panels must be
    derived from either the :class:`.ControlPanel` or :class:`.ControlToolBar`
    base-classes.


    **Profiles**


    Some ``ViewPanel`` classes have relatively complex mouse and keyboard
    interaction behaviour (e.g. the :class:`.OrthoPanel` and
    :class:`.LightBoxPanel`). The logic defines this interaction is provided
    by a :class:`.Profile` instance, and is managed by a
    :class:`.ProfileManager`.  Some ``ViewPanel`` classes have multiple
    interaction profiles - for example, the :class:`.OrthoPanel` has a
    ``view`` profile, and an ``edit`` profile. The current interaction
    profile can be changed with the :attr:`profile` property, and can be
    accessed with the :meth:`getCurrentProfile` method. See the
    :mod:`.profiles` package for more information on interaction profiles.


    **Programming interface**


    The following methods are available on a ``Viewpanel`` for programmatically
    controlling its display and layout:


    .. autosummary::
       :nosignatures:

       togglePanel
       isPanelOpen

    I have only seen this behaviour when using XQuartz on macOS.

    ``AuiFloatingFrame`` class derives). Removing this style flag fixes the
    problem, so this is exactly what I'm doing. I haven't looked any deeper
