Unofficial HackForums API v2 Integration in Python 3
====================================================

Purpose
-------

Other public Python implementations of the HackForums API have shown to
be immature or varying levels of incomplete. The goal of this project is
to provide a fully usable Python API for Hackforums available through
``pip``. **hfapi** features include: - Read/Write profile user profile
information - Easy and intuitive integration with Python network
applications - Synchronous (requests) and Asynchronous (aiohttp)
implementations - All API objects are defined with Pydantic

How-To: Install
---------------

Installation is easy!

::

   python3 -m pip install -U hfapi

How-To Use
----------

The synchronous and asynchronous API implementations are identical in
functionality and usage with the addition of ``await`` syntax in the
asynchronous version.

::

   # use "HFApp" and "HFClient" for synchronous
   from hfapi import HFAppAsync, HFClientAsync
   
   app = """ EXAMPLE WEB SERVER HERE """
   
   hf = HFAppAsync(
       client_id="[CLIENT_ID]",
       secret_key="[SECRET_KEY]",
       redirect_uri="https://example.com/authorize",
   )

   # Hackforums will submit a GET request with "code" as a parameter
   @app.get("/authorize")
   async def authorize(code: str):
       # use the `hf.authorize` method to create a client session
       client = await hf.authorize(code)
       me = await client.me(all=True)  # collect all (possible) data from current user
       return me.dict()
