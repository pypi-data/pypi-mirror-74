        Structure of the map is:

                '#'      :  dependencies
                'fieldA' :  dependencies
                }
            }

        ``model`` denotes the source model of a given instance. ``'fieldA'`` points to
        a field that was changed. The right side contains the dependencies
        in the form

        .. code:: python

            {dependent_model: (fields, filter_strings)}

        In ``update_dependent`` the information will be used to create a queryset
        and save their elements (roughly):

        .. code:: python

            queryset = dependent_model.objects.filter(string1=instance)
            queryset |= dependent_model.objects.filter(string2=instance)
            for obj in queryset:
                obj.save(update_fields=fields)

        The ``'#'`` is a special placeholder to indicate, that a model object
        was saved normally. It contains the plain and non computed field dependencies.

        The separation of dependencies to computed fields and to other fields makes it
        possible to create complex computed field dependencies, even multiple times
        between the same objects without running into circular dependencies:

        .. CODE:: python

            class A(ComputedFieldsModel):
                @computed(..., depends=['b_set#comp_b'])
                def comp_a(self):
                     ...

            class B(ComputedFieldsModel):
                a = ForeignKey(B)
                @computed(..., depends=['a'])
                def comp_b(self):
                    ...

        Here ``A.comp_a`` depends on ``b.com_b`` which itself somehow depends on ``A``.
        If an instance of ``A`` gets saved, the corresponding objects in ``B``
        will be updated, which triggers a final update of ``comp_a`` fields
        on associated ``A`` objects.

        .. CAUTION::

            If there are only computed fields in ``update_fields`` always use
            those dependencies, never ``'#'``. This is important to ensure
            cycle free database updates. For computed fields the corresponding
            dependencies should always be used to get properly updated.

        .. NOTE::
            The created map is also used for the pickle file to circumvent
            the computationally expensive graph and map creation in production mode.
