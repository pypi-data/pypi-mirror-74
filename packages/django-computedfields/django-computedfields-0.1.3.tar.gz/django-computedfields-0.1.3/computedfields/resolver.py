class Resolver:

    Holds the needed data for graph calculations and runtime dependency resolving.

    Basic workflow:

        - On django startup a resolver gets instantiated early to track all project-wide
          model registrations and computed field decorations (collector phase).
        - On `app.ready` the computed fields are associated with their models to build
          a resolver-wide map of models with computed fields (``computed_models``).
        - After that the resolver maps get loaded, either by building from scratch or
          by loading them from a pickled map file.

    .. NOTE::

        To avoid the rather expensive map creation from scratch in production mode later on
        the map data should be pickled into a map file by setting ``COMPUTEDFIELDS_MAP``
        in `settings.py` to a writable file path and calling the management
        command ``createmap``.

        Currently the map file does not support automatic recreation, therefore it must be
        recreated manually by calling ``createmap`` after model code changes. The resolver
        tracks changes to dependency rules and might warn you about an outdated map file.
        An outdated map file will not be used, instead a full graph reduction will be done.

        Updates all dependent computed fields on related models traversing
        the dependency tree as shown in the graphs.

        This is the main entry hook of the resolver to do updates on dependent
        computed fields during runtime. While this is done automatically for
        model instance actions from signal handlers, you have to call it yourself
        after changes done by bulk actions.

        To do that, simply call this function after the update with the queryset
        containing the changed objects:

            >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(comments_on=False)
            >>> update_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010))

        This can also be used with ``bulk_create``. Since ``bulk_create``
        returns the objects in a python container, you have to create the queryset
        yourself, e.g. with pks:

            >>> objs = Entry.objects.bulk_create([
            ...     Entry(headline='This is a test'),
            ...     Entry(headline='This is only a test'),
            ... ])
            >>> pks = set(obj.pk for obj in objs)
            >>> update_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pk__in=pks))

        .. NOTE::

            Getting pks from ``bulk_create`` is not supported by all database adapters.
            With a local computed field you can "cheat" here by providing a sentinel:

                >>> MyComputedModel.objects.bulk_create([
                ...     MyComputedModel(comp='SENTINEL'), # here or as default field value
                ...     MyComputedModel(comp='SENTINEL'),
                ... ])
                >>> update_dependent(MyComputedModel.objects.filter(comp='SENTINEL'))

            If the sentinel is beyond reach of the method result, this even ensures to update
            only the newly added records.

        `instance` can also be a single model instance. Since calling ``save`` on a model instance
        will trigger this function by the `post_save` signal already it should not be called
        for single instances, if they get saved anyway.

        `update_fields` can be used to indicate, that only certain fields on the queryset changed,
        which helps to further narrow down the records to be updated.

        Special care is needed, if a bulk action contains foreign key changes,
        that are part of a computed field dependency chain. To correctly handle that case,
        provide the result of ``preupdate_dependent`` as `old` argument like this:

                >>> # given: some computed fields model depends somehow on Entry.fk_field

        Decorator to create computed fields.

        `field` should be a model concrete field instance suitable to hold the result
        of the decorated method. The decorator expects a keyword argument `depends`
        to indicate dependencies to model fields (local or related).
        Listed dependencies will automatically update the computed field.

        Examples:

            - create a char field with no further dependencies (not very useful)

            .. code-block:: python

                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32))
                def ...

            - create a char field with a dependency to the field ``name`` on a
              foreign key relation ``fk``

            .. code-block:: python

                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[['fk', ['name']]])
                def ...

        Dependencies should be listed as ``['relation_name', concrete_fieldnames]``.
        The relation can span serveral models, simply name the relation
        in python style with a dot (e.g. ``'a.b.c'``). A relation can be any of
        foreign key, m2m, o2o and their back relations. The fieldnames must point to
        concrete fields on the foreign model.

        .. NOTE::

            Dependencies to model local fields should be list with ``'self'`` as relation name.

        With `select_related` and `prefetch_related` you can instruct the dependency resolver
        to apply certain optimizations on the update queryset.

        .. NOTE::

            `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are stacked over computed fields
            of the same model during updates, that are marked for update.
            If your optimizations contain custom attributes (as with `to_attr` of a
            `Prefetch` object), these attributes will only be available on instances
            during updates from the resolver, never on newly constructed instances or
            model instances pulled by other means, unless you applied the same lookups manually.

            To keep the computed field methods working under any circumstances,
            it is a good idea not to rely on lookups with custom attributes,
            or to test explicitly for them in the method with an appropriate plan B.

        .. CAUTION::

            With the dependency resolver you can easily create recursive dependencies
            by accident. Imagine the following:

            .. code-block:: python

                class A(ComputedFieldsModel):
                    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[['b_set', ['comp']]])
                    def comp(self):
                        return ''.join(b.comp for b in self.b_set.all())

                class B(ComputedFieldsModel):
                    a = models.ForeignKey(A)

                    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[['a', ['comp']]])
                    def comp(self):
                        return a.comp

            Neither an object of `A` or `B` can be saved, since the ``comp`` fields depend on
            each other. While it is quite easy to spot for this simple case it might get tricky
            for more complicated dependencies. Therefore the dependency resolver tries
            to detect cyclic dependencies and might raise a ``CycleNodeException`` during
            startup.

            If you experience this in your project try to get in-depth cycle
            information, either by using the ``rendergraph`` management command or
            by directly accessing the graph objects:

            - intermodel dependency graph: ``active_resolver._graph``
            - mode local dependency graphs: ``active_resolver._graph.modelgraphs[your_model]``
            - union graph: ``active_resolver._graph.get_uniongraph()``

            Note that there is not graph object, when running with ``COMPUTEDFIELDS_MAP = True``.
            In that case either comment out that line `settings.py` and restart the server
            or build the graph at runtime with:

                >>> from computedfields.graph import ComputedModelsGraph
                >>> from computedfields.resolver import active_resolver
                >>> graph = ComputedModelsGraph(active_resolver.computed_models)
