Description: # Downsampling high resolution images using the scattering transform
        Atlasing high resolution data,Scattering transform, Visualization of imges, Downsampling with multiple methods
        
        # Usage
        `python3 -m scatter_downsample -i IMAGE -n NUMBER OF DOWNSAMPLE [-s] [filtered standard deviation channels] [-d] [directions for gaussian] [-m] [methods]`
        
        or 
        
        `import scatter_downsample` in python3 environment
        
        ## ScatterDown(img,ndown2,filtered_std=2,method=1,direction=2):
        Input:
        
            - img: input image
            - ndown2: how many times to downsample by a factor of 2
            - filtered_std: how many standard deviations maximum should not get filtered out (default 2)
            - direction numbers: for gaussian downsampling (default 2)
            - method: (default 1)
                - 2*2 mean and standard deviation (1)
                - 2*2 mean and standard deviation with directions (2)
                - Gaussian filtering (3)
        
        Output: 
        
            - high dimensional image in ndarray form
            - labels for each channel
            - an example visualization that you save as a png file
        
        # Tests
        installed by: `python -m unittest tests/testcase.py`
        
        - an example image to test for the shape of output image and labels for method 1 (mean and std)
        
        # Versions
        ## 0.2.4
        - Add options for Gaussian Downsampling
        - Add Gaussian Flipping and Rotations methods
        - Setup requirements.txt for auto download required modules
        
        ## 0.2.0
        Add in updated methods (mean/std with directions and gaussian filtering), add command line interfaces with argparse
