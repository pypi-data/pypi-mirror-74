Description: 
        Cloudknot
        =========
        Cloudknot is a python library designed to run your existing python code on
        AWS Batch
        
        Cloudknot takes as input a python function, Dockerizes it for use in an Amazon
        ECS instance, and creates all the necessary AWS Batch constituent resources to
        submit jobs. You can then use cloudknot to submit and view jobs for a range of
        inputs.
        
        To get started using cloudknot, please see the documentation_.
