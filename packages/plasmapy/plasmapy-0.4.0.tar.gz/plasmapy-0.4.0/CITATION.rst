Acknowledging and Citing PlasmaPy
=================================

If you use PlasmaPy for a project resulting in a publication, we
ask that you include a line such as the following in the
acknowledgements section of your paper:

* This research made use of version 0.2.0 of PlasmaPy, a
  community-developed open source Python package for plasma physics
  (PlasmaPy Community et al. 2018, 2019) that has been developed with
  support from the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S.
  Department of Energy.

This line should reference the specific version of PlasmaPy that was
used in the paper in order to facilitate scientific reproducibility.
For example, version 0.2.0 of PlasmaPy may be cited using the following
reference:

* PlasmaPy Community et al. (2019). *PlasmaPy version 0.2.0*, Zenodo,
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3235817
