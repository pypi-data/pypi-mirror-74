Acknowledging and Citing
========================

If you use PlasmaPy for a project resulting in a publication, we ask
that you cite both the specific version of PlasmaPy used in your
project and an informational reference.  Including these references
provides credit to developers of PlasmaPy and enables greater
scientific reproducibility.

Version 0.2.0 of PlasmaPy may be cited using the following reference.

* PlasmaPy Community et al. (2019). *PlasmaPy version 0.2.0*, Zenodo,
  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3235817

The current standard informational reference for PlasmaPy is

* PlasmaPy Community, Nicholas A. Murphy, Andrew J. Leonard, Dominik
  Sta≈Ñczak, Pawel M. Kozlowski, Samuel J. Langendorf, Colby C. Haggerty,
  Jasper P. Beckers, Stuart J. Mumford, Tulasi N. Parashar, and Yi-Min
  Huang. (2018). *PlasmaPy: an open source community-developed
  Python package for plasma physics*, Zenodo,
  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1238132

These references may be made by adding the following line to the
methods or acknowledgements sections of a paper.

* This research made use of PlasmaPy version 0.2.0, a
  community-developed open source Python package for plasma
  physics (PlasmaPy Community et al. 2018, 2019).

All public releases of PlasmaPy are openly archived in the `PlasmaPy
Community <https://zenodo.org/communities/plasmapy>`__ on `Zenodo
<https://zenodo.org>`__.

We encourage authors to acknowledge the packages that PlasmaPy
depends on, including but not limited to
