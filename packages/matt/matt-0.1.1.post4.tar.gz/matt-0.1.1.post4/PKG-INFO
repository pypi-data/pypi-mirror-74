# Matt
Matt is a free software (licensed under the [GNU GPL v3 (or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)) maths test program.
"Matt" (or "MATT") is a recursive acronym for "MATT Arithmetic Training Test".

## Installation
Matt depends on:
 * [termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/)
 * [pyxdg](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pyxdg/)
 * [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) (windows only)

There are 2 methods of installation: via poetry and via pip:

### Installation via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
Poetry should handle the installation of dependencies.
To install, first clone the git repository, then run:
```sh
poetry install
```

### Installation via pip
Pip should handle the installation of dependencies.
To install, run:
```sh
python3 -m pip install matt
```

## Usage
Run `python3 -m matt -h` for help.
Matt accepts the following arguments:
 * `--difficulty` or `-d` to set the difficulty (in the format "<namespace>:<number>").
   The `default` namespace is reserved for the default difficulties.
   If unspecified the default is `default:1`.
 * `--operations` or `-o` to set the available operations.
   Operations are seperated by commas, the available operations are:
   - `+`: Addition
   - `-`: Subtraction
   - `*`: Multiplication
   - `/`: Division
   Example: `-o +,-` to enable only addition and subtraction.
 * `--minimum` or `-m` to set the minumum, default (if not specified in difficulty): 0.
 * `--maximum` or `-M` to set the maximum, default (if not specified in difficulty): 10.
NOTE: The maximum must not be equivalent to the minimum.

## Config
Matt has a configuration file, it is written in Python,
and located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matt/config.py`.
By default `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to `~/.config`,
so if you have not set it then it is probably `~/.config/matt/config.py`.

The configuration must provide a difficulty function that accepts 2 parameters:
 * `namespace` (str): The namespace of the difficulty.
 * ``number`` (int): The number of the difficulty.

The ``difficulty`` function must return a dict.

A simple example is:
```python
def difficulty(namespace: str, number: int) -> dict:
    if namespace == "manual":
       if number == 1:
           return {
               "operations": ["+", "-"],
               "maximum": 20,
               "minimum": 10
           }
```

Due to the config file being written in Python,
it is extemely configurable, for example:
```python
def difficulty(namespace: str, number: int) -> dict:
    if namespace == "automatic":
        return {
            "operations": ["+", "-", "*", "/"],
            "maximum": number * 10
        }
```
