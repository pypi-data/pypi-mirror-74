# Minimally Sufficient Pandas - The Library

This library is intended to help simplify the usage of pandas DataFrames by limiting the number of available methods to just those that are the most powerful. It also adds a few convenience methods not previously available and enhances some already existing methods.

## Installation

`pip install minimally_sufficient_pandas`
