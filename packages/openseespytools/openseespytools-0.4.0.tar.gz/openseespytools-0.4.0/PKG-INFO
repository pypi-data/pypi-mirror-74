Description: My set of data processing tools for Opensees.
        It's broken into three sets of tools: tools for data processing, tools for plotting xy response curves, and tools for understainding OpenSeesPy models.
        The data processing tools are geared towards being able to sample XY data curves.
        The response tools are geared towards understanding the outputs of specific OpenSees responses, i.e force-disp relationshipts
        The model tools are used to understand the response of a whole OpenSeesPy model, and are geared towards visualization.
