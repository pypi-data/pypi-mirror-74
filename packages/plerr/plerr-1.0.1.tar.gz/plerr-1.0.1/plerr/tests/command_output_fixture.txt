[01m[35m###[39;49;00m Rationale:

Either all [33m`return`[39;49;00m statements in a function should [33m`return`[39;49;00m an expression, 
or none of them should. According to **`PEP8`**, if any [33m`return`[39;49;00m statement
returns an expression, any [33m`return`[39;49;00m statements where no value is returned
should explicitly state this as [33m`return None`[39;49;00m, and an explicit [33m`return`[39;49;00m
statement should be present at the end of the function (if reachable).
