# TimeCall.py
#
# Class that handles timing of operations. You can frame any operation
# with a "timing" and then report on it anytime during the execution
# of your routine.

== Import

from QumuloUtils import TimeCall

== Invocation

@TimeCall
def SomeRoutineThatYouHaveWritten:

Put the @TimeCall just before the definition of the routine that you wish to time.
That is all that you have to do to capture how long each routine takes to execute.

== Reporting

When you wish to output the counts and timing, you only have to issue a print or some other
statement where you pass in one of the TimeCall routines.

print ("Counts %s" % TimeCall.counts())
print ("Minimums %s" % TimeCall.minimums())
print ("Maximums %s" % TimeCall.maximums())
print ("Averages %s" % TimeCall.averages())
