        ## Notes
        - Playback and device-related commands require at least one active Spotify session on any device.
          - You can just start and stop playback to "activate" your device.
          - Your device will remain "active" even when paused.
        - Some operations may not be supported on certain devices (i.e. volume control for mobile).
        - Behavior may differ for users not subscribed to Spotify Premium.
        - In development: search, browse, more playback options, custom auth scopes.
