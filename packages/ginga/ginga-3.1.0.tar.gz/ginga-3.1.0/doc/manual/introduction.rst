About
=====

Ginga is a toolkit designed for building viewers for scientific image
data in Python, visualizing 2D pixel data in numpy arrays.  
The Ginga toolkit can view astronomical data such as contained in files based on the
FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file format.  

The Ginga toolkit is written and maintained by software engineers at the Subaru Telescope, National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan. The code is released as open-source under a BSD license and maintained at http://ejeschke.github.io/ginga/

Features
========

The Ginga toolkit centers around an image display widget that supports 
zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several
automatic cut levels algorithms, and canvases for plotting scalable
geometric forms.  

In addition to this widget, a general purpose
reference FITS viewer is provided, based on a plugin framework.
A relatively complete set of standard plugins are provided for features
that we expect from a modern FITS viewer: panning and zooming windows,
star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm, thumbnails, etc.
