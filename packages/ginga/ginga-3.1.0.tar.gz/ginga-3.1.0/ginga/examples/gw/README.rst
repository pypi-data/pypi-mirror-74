=====

The examples in this directory are all written using "Ginga Widgets"--a
wrapper around the supported toolkits for the Ginga reference viewer.
You can run them using any one of the supported toolkits (assuming that
you have the toolkit-native Python bindings installed) using the -t
or --toolkit option.

For example, to run example2.py do the following::

    $ python example2.py -t qt

To see what toolkits are available, use the --show-toolkits option
