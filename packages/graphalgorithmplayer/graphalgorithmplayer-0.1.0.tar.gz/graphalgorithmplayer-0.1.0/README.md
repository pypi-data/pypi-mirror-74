# GraphAlgorithmPlayer
Visualize how a graph is processed by an algorithm with either networkx or bqplot thanks to a player.

For each step of your algorithm and using the Networkx view you may change the color and label of each node and edge.
BQPlot only allows the user to change the color of nodes.
