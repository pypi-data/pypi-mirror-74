class InvalidCurveAttack(object):
    """
    The Invalid Curve attack takes advantage of systems that don't validate whether the other party's public key is on the curve.
    The attacker can generate curves of smoother order with a different `b` constant, and then generate a public key
    that lies inside of a subgroup.

    There are two phases to this attack:
        1) Finding residues modulo the small factors of the group order
        2) Bruteforcing the residue configuration. (ZZ/ZZ(67))(15) may actually be (ZZ/ZZ(67))(52).

    Conditions:
    * Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman is being used
    * The user has access to an oracle that accepts arbitrary public keys and returns the residue
