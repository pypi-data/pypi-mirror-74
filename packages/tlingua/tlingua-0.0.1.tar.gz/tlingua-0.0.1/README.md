# TLingua

TLingua is a token-based language/grammar/text processing library built to simulate rule-governed recursively replicatable grammar.

### Tech

Currently the implementation depends only on basic(pre-installed) python packages, without any fancy-special tech introduction.

And of course Lingua itself is open source with a [public repository][TLingua]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Lingua is published and distributed via PyPI.

```sh
pip install tlingua
```

### Plugins

Lingua doesn't have plugins as it's too no-name of a package to begin with. Probably never going to even receive an update or security-issue-related bump.

### To-dos

 - Write tests.
 - Make usable.
 - Make better.
