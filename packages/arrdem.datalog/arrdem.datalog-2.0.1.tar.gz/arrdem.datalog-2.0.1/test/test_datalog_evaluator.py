#
#   This test is BROKEN for the simple dataset.  In order for left-recursive production rules to
#   work, they have to ground out somewhere.  Under the naive, cache-less datalog this is an
#   infinite left recursion.  Under the cached versions, the right-recursion becomes iteration over
#   an incrementally realized list which ... is weird but does work because the recursion grounds
#   out in iterating over an empty list on the 2nd round then falls through to the other production
#   rule which generates ground tuples and feeds everything.
#
#   It's not clear how to make this work with the current (lack of) query planner on the naive db as
#   really fixing this requires some amount of insight into the data dependency structure and may
#   involve reordering rules.
