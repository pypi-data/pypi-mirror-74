Description: # Mopac Price Check
        Checks prices of the Mopac Express lane in Austin
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        The official Mopac Express Lane website only uses the now-deprecated TLS 1.0. Support for this has been removed from most web browsers, or will be soon, including Chrome and Firefox. So if you're using a recent version of Debian/Ubuntu with openssl 1.1.1 the system's security settings may not support accessing that website.
