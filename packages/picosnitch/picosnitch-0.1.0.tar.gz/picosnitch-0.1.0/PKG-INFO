Description: # picosnitch
        - See which processes make remote network connections  
        - Logs and config are stored in ~/.config/picosnitch/snitch.json and updated every 10 minutes or on sigterm  
        - Do not rely on this for security or anything remotely critical (only checks connections at 0.2s intervals and could miss very short lived ones, would need a network driver or event listener for better reliability)  
        - Quick experiment inspired by programs such as:  
          - Little Snitch
          - OpenSnitch
          - GlassWire
          - simplewall
        # run
        - run as a daemon (regular process on windows) with  
        `python picosnitch.py`
        - or install from source with  
        `python setup.py install`
        - or install from PyPI with  
        `pip install picosnitch`
        - then run as a daemon with  
        `picosnitch`
