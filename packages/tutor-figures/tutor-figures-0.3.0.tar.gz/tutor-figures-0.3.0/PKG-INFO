        Installation
        ------------
        
        This plugin requires tutor>=3.5.0. Also, you should have installed tutor from source, and not from a pre-compiled binary.
        
        ::
          
            pip install tutor-figures
        
        Then, to enable this plugin, run::
          
            tutor plugins enable figures
        
        You will have to re-generate the environment and rebuild the "openedx" docker image::
          
            tutor config save
            tutor images build openedx
        
        You will then have to run LMS migrations. To do so, run::
          
            tutor local init
        
        This last step is unnecessary if you run instead ``tutor local quickstart``.
        
        You should then be able to access the Figures dashboard at ``http://<your lms host>/figures``. On a local instance, you should be able to access it at http://localhost/figures.
