Descriptions
-------------------------------

Collage is a image combiner to combine lists of arrays.

This is Collage Maker, it makes the collage with borders.

You may want to set the ``border_px``, ``border_bg``, ``direction`` to let it work.

By default, ``border_px=3, border_color=[255, 255, 255, 255]``

Usage:

>>> from collage_maker import make_collage
>>> make_collage(images=[
...         [image_a, image_b],
...         [image_c, image_d, [image_f, image_g]]
...    ],
...    direction=0, border_px=1, border_color=[0, 0, 0, 255])

.. note:: The border_color is of length 4 because images are length 4.
