        Collage is a image combiner to combine lists of arrays.
        
        This is Collage Maker, it makes the collage with borders.
        
        You may want to set the ``border_px``, ``border_bg``, ``direction`` to let it work.
        
        By default, ``border_px=3, border_color=[255, 255, 255, 255]``
        
        Usage:
        ```python
        from collage_maker import make_collage
        collage = make_collage(images=[
                [image_a, image_b],
                [image_c, image_d, [image_f, image_g]]
            ],
            direction=0, border_px=1, border_color=[0, 0, 0, 255])
        ```
        
        .. note:: The border_color is of length 4 because images are length 4.
