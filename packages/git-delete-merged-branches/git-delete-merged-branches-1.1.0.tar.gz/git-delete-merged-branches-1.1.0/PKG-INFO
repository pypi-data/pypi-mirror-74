        # Safety
        
        Deletion is a sharp knife that requires care.
        While `git reflog` would have your back in most cases,
        `git-delete-merged-branches` takes safety seriously.
        
        Here's what `git-delete-merged-branches` does for your safety:
        - No branches are deleted without confirmation or passing `--yes`.
        - Confirmation defaults to "no"; plain `[Enter]`/`[Return]` does not delete.
        - `git push` is used with `--force-with-lease` so if the server and you have a different understanding of that branch, it is not deleted.
        - There is no use of `os.system` or shell code to go wrong.
        - With `--dry-run` you can get a feel for the changes that `git-delete-merged-branches` would be making to your branches.
        - Show any Git commands run using `--verbose`.
        
        
        # Best Practices
        
        - Consider running `git remote update --prune` before using `git-delete-merged-branches` for best results.
        - Consider using `ssh-agent` if you don't want to enter your SSH key password for each `git push` when working with multiple remotes.
