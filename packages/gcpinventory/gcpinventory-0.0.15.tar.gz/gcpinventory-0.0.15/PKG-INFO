                    1. Identify the Primary region

                       This is needed as there is no tag in the instance that identifies a disk as regional
                    3. Get the attatched disk for the primary instance. Skip all the boot and  zonal disks
                    4. Force attach to standby instance
                    5. ssh into standby instance
                    6. mount the drive

        ### API Usage
        Example:
        
            from gcpinventory import gcpinventory as inventory_service    
            import logging
            logger = logging.getLogger()
            logging.basicConfig()
            logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
            
            inventory_service = inventory_service.InventoryService()
