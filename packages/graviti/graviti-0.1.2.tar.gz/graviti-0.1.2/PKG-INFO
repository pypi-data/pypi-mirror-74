Description: # Graviti python SDK
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install graviti
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        #### Get accessKey
        
        AccessKey is required when upload data.
        
        Use your username and password to login to [Graviti website](https://gas.graviti.cn/),
        and get accessKey on profile page.
        
        #### Upload data
        
        This sample is for uploading dataset which only contains data collected from a single sensor.
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        from graviti import GAS
        
        ACCESS_KEY = "Accesskey-****"
        DATA_SET_NAME = "TestDataSet"
        
        gas = GAS(ACCESS_KEY)
        
        data_set = gas.get_or_create_data_set(DATA_SET_NAME)  # create dataset
        
        # single-thread upload
        for filename in FILE_LIST:
            data_set.upload_data(filename, "remote_path")
        
        # # multi-thread uploading
        # # when use multi-thread uploading
        # # uncomment the following code and comment single-thread uploading code
        
        # from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
        
        # THREAD_NUM = 8 # number of threads
        
        # with ThreadPoolExecutor(THREAD_NUM) as executor:
        #     for filename in FILE_LIST:
        #         executor.submit(data_set.upload_data, filename, "remote_path")
        ```
        
        #### Upload multisensor data
        
        This sample is for uploading dataset which contains data collected from multi sensors.
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        from graviti import GAS
        from graviti import Sensor, Frame
        
        ACCESS_KEY = "Accesskey-****"
        DATA_SET_NAME = "TestMultisensorDataSet"
        
        gas = GAS(ACCESS_KEY)
        
        data_set = gas.get_or_create_data_set(DATA_SET_NAME, is_multisensor=True)  # create multisensor dataset
        
        for sensor_name in SENSOR_LIST:
            sensor = Sensor(sensor_name, Sensor.CAMERA)
            sensor.set_description("This is a camera")
            sensor.set_translation(x=1.1, y=2.2, z=3.3)
            sensor.set_rotation(w=1.1, x=2.2, y=3.3, z=4.4)
            sensor.set_camera_matrix(fx=1.1, fy=2.2, cx=3.3, cy=4.4)
            sensor.set_distortion_coefficient(p1=1.1, p2=2.2, k1=3.3, k2=4.4, k3=5.5)
        
            data_set.upload_sensor(sensor)
        
        # single-thread uploading
        for frame_info in FRAME_LIST:
            frame = Frame()
            for sensor_name in SENSOR_LIST:
                frame.add_data(sensor_name, frame_info.filename, "remote_path", frame_info.timestamp)
        
            data_set.upload_frame(frame)
        
        # # multi-thread uploading
        # # when use multi-thread uploading
        # # uncomment the following code and comment single-thread uploading code
        
        # from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
        
        # THREAD_NUM = 8  # number of threads
        
        # with ThreadPoolExecutor(THREAD_NUM) as executor:
        # for frame_info in FRAME_LIST:
        #     frame = Frame()
        #     for sensor_name in SENSOR_LIST:
        #         frame.add_data(sensor_name, frame_info.filename, "remote_path", frame_info.timestamp)
        
        #         executor.submit(data_set.upload_frame, frame)
        ```
        
        #### Command line
        
        We also provide `gas` command to call SDK APIs.
        
        Use `gas` in terminal to see the available commands as follows.
        
        ```bash
        gas config
        gas create
        gas delete
        gas publish
        gas ls
        gas cp
        gas rm
        ```
        
        ##### accessKey config
        
        ```bash
        gas config [accessKey]
        
        # this command writes accesskey into config file
        ```
        
        ##### create dataset
        
        ```bash
        gas create [dataset_name]
        ```
        
        ##### delete dataset
        
        ```bash
        gas delete [dataset_name]
        ```
        
        ##### publish dataset
        
        ```bash
        gas publish [dataset_name]
        ```
        
        ##### list data
        
        ```bash
        gas ls [dataset_name]://[remote_path]
        ```
        
        ##### upload data
        
        ```bash
        gas cp [Options] [local_path1] [local_path2] ...  [dataset name]://[remote_path]
        
        Options:
          -r, --recursive     Copy directories recursively.
          -j, --jobs INTEGER  The number of threads.
        
        # if only upload one file and [remote path] doesn't end with '/'
        # then the file will be uploaded and renamed as [remote_path]
        
        # multi-thread upload: -j THREAD_NUM
        ```
        
        ##### delete data
        
        ```bash
        gas rm [Options] [dataset name]://[remote_path]
        
        Options:
          -r, --recursive  Remove directories recursively.
        
        # one single command can only delete one remote path
        # if '-r' then all the paths under [remote_path] and itself will be deleted
        ```
