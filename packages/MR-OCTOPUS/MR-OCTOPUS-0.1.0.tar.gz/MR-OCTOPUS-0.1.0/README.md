# OCTOPUS: Off-resonance CorrecTion OPen-soUrce Software
OCTOPUS is an open-source tool that provides off-resonance correction  methods for  Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. In particular, the implemented techniques are Conjugate Phase Reconstruction (CPR)[[1]](#references), frequency-segmented CPR [[2]](#references) and Multi-Frequency Interpolation (MFI) [[3]](#references).

Off-resonance is a type of MR image artifact. It originates as an accumulation of phase from off-resonant spins along the read-out direction due to field inhomogeneities, tissue susceptibilities and chemical shift among other possible sources [[4]](#references). Long read-out k-space trajectories are therefore more prone to this artifact and its consequences on the image. The image effects are tipycally blurring and/or geometrical distortion, and consequently, quality deterioration [[5]](#references).

OCTOPUS leverages existing techniques and outputs artifact-corrected or mitigated image reconstruction given the raw data from the scanner, k-space trajectory and field map. It is targeted to MR scientists, researchers, engineers and students who work with off-resonance-prone trajectories, such as spirals.
