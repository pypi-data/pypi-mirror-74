# ContainDS Dashboards for JupyterHub

A Dashboard publishing solution for Data Science teams to share results with decision makers.

Run a private on-premise or cloud-based JupyterHub with extensions to instantly publish apps and notebooks as user-friendly 
interactive dashboards to share with non-technical colleagues.

Currently supported frameworks:
- Jupyter notebooks ([Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) apps
- [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) apps
- [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/) / [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) apps and notebooks
- [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps
- Any custom server or framework

This open source package allows data scientists to instantly and reliably publish interactive 
notebooks or other scripts as secure interactive web apps.

Source files can be pulled from a Git repo or from the user's Jupyter tree.

Any authorised JupyterHub user can view the dashboard.

**See [full documentation](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/)**

## How it works

- Data scientist creates a Jupyter Notebook as normal or uploads Python/R files etc
- Data scientist creates a new Dashboard to clone their Jupyter server
- Other logged-in JupyterHub users see the dashboard in their list
- Click to launch as a server, using OAuth to gain access
- User sees a safe user-friendly version of the original notebook - served by Voila, Streamlit, Dash, Bokeh, R Shiny etc.

All of this works through a new Dashboards menu item added to JupyterHub's header.

## Requirements

Basic requirements:

- JupyterHub 1.0+
- Python 3.6+

You should be able to use any authenticator for users to login - for example, corporate Google email sign in, or LDAP.

Any JupyterHub distribution should be suitable, depending on configuration. See [requirements](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/chapters/requirements.html).

## Installation

Full [Setup and Installation details](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/chapters/setup/setup.html) are in the documentation.

## Contact and Support

This software is an alpha version. Please see LICENSE for details.

Please do get in touch if you try out the package, or would like to but need some support. I would be very interested to find out how it can be used, and to work (without charge) to help you get it running. The project needs feedback in order to develop further!
