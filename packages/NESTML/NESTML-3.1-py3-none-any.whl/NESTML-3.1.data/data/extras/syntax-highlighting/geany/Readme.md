Syntax highlighting for Geany
=============================

The file ``filetypes.NestML.conf`` provides definitions for syntax highlighting with the lightweight IDE [Geany](https://www.geany.org/).

Use
---

Simply copy-paste the file to you local Geany configuration folder. On most Unix platforms, this is in ``~/.config/geany/filedefs/``.

Limitations
-----------

This is just a syntax highlighting scheme which uses the Python lexer, and not a NESTML-specific lexer. As such, it will probably not always work.
However, this should still be a significant improvement over no syntax highlighting ;)
