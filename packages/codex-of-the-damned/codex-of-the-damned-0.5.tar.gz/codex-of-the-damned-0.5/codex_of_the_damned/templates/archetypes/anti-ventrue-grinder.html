<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    Often spelled <strong>!Ventrue Grinder</strong>
    (the "!" prefix has been used to denote the antitribu clans for a while),
    this is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using the Ventrue antitribu clan and their <i>fad</i> disciplines combination.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get the highest capacity vampire out,
    then use {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}
    at superior <i>D</i> to get more vampires out fast and cheap, then later to bleed with the help of
    {{ card("Conditioning") }} and
    {{ card("Bonding") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module uses <i>A</i> for intercept, wakes and bounces, and <i>d</i> for additional
    bounces with {{ card("Deflection") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses <i>f</i> for damage prevention and
    {{ card("Weighted Walking Stick") }} to deal
    more damage.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is on the slow side, grinding at the opponents blood and pool reserves during the game until it
    can finally lunge to oust its prey.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Daring the Dawn") }} is kept for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has not much stealth, so it uses some <em>powerbleed</em> techniques, like
    {{ card("Pentexâ„¢ Subversion") }} and
    {{ card("Anarch Troublemaker") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many small variations to this archetype:
    <li>
        {{ card("The Coven") }} is a rare inclusion: the deck is supposed
        to grind the blood out of the table, so giving opponents the opportunity to get some of it back
        is a bit of a stretch.
        {{ card("The Rack") }} is more often seen.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("The Kiss of Ra") }},
        {{ card("Misdirection") }} and
        {{ card("Seduction") }} can be used to help get the bleed through.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Abbot") }},
        {{ card("Bowl of Convergence") }} and permanent intercept
        locations like {{ card("KRCG News Radio") }}
        are often included to help with intercept.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Ivory Bow") }} and
        {{ card("Target Vitals") }}
        are often seen in the combat module.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Freak Drive") }} is sometimes added to increase
        {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }}.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Guns Grinder</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Concealed Weapon") }} and guns in the combat module,
    like in {{ link("/deck-search", _("Ravel Zorzal's deck"), twda_id="2016bncsb") }}
    from the 2016 Brazilian NC.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Protean Grinder</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Lazverinus, Thrall of Lambach") }} and
    {{ card("Dylan") }} int the crypt for <i>j</i>, in order to include
    {{ card("Claws of the Dead") }} and
    {{ card("Earth Meld") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Jackson Iribarren's deck"), twda_id="2k9sac") }}
    , won the 2009 SAC with it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Powerbleed</strong> variant focuses on bleed more,
    using only {{ card("Aura Reading") }} with some
    <i>f</i> prevention for the combat module.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Bob Joseph's deck"), twda_id="2018nacd2co") }}
    won the 2018 NAC with it.
