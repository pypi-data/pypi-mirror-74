<h2 id="bleed">Bleed</h2>
<p>
    Bleed decks are focused on prey aggression and use bleed actions to inflict heavy pool damages.
    <i>d</i> is without question the most damage-heavy bleed discipline, plus it does come with bounce cards.
    <i>r</i> and <i>e</i> are good second choices.
</p>
<h3>Stealth & Bleed and Powerbleed</h3>
<p>
    There are two ways to get bleeds through: using <strong>stealth</strong> is the most obvious one.
    <i>o</i> is the best stealth discipline, but it does not often come along with <i>d</i>.
    <i>$</i> and <i>j</i> come second.
</p>
<p>
    The other way to get bleeds through is to make sure the prey has no minion available to block the action.
    Along its strong bleed capabilities, <i>d</i> offers the excellent
    {{ card("Seduction") }}.
    <i>O</i> {{ card("Elder Impersonation") }},
    <i>N</i> {{ card("Call of the Hungry Dead") }},
    <i>f</i> {{ card("Daring the Dawn") }} and
    <i>r</i> {{ card("Mind Numb") }} are also effective tools.
    Combining these options with the few Master cards that can prevent block or lock minions —
    {{ card("Pentex™ Subversion") }},
    {{ card("Misdirection") }} and
    {{ card("Anarch Troublemaker") }} —
    makes stealth and intercept irrelevant.
</p>
<h3>Flavours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lasombra <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-lasombra.svg') }}"> and Kiasyd <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-kiasyd.svg') }}">
        have a strong combination with <i>d</i> for bleed and <i>$</i> for stealth.
        Check the {{ link("/archetypes/kiasyd-stealth-bleed", _("Kiasyd Stealth & Bleed")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/lasombra-nocturn", _("Lasombra Nocturn")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Malkavian <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-malkavian.svg') }}"> can use <i>e</i>,
        alone or alongside <i>o</i>,
        for devastating bleeds, like in the {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-dem", _("Weenie DEM")) }} archetype.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assamite <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-assamite.svg') }}"> also have a nice
        combination with <i>q</i> and <i>o</i>,
        as in the {{ link("/archetypes/black-hand", _("Black Hand")) }} archetype.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>d</i> also works well in weenie archetypes, like
        {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-dom", _("Weenie DOM")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/bima-dominate", _("Bima Dominate")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unsing <i>J</i> for stealth gave birth to powerful bleed deck,
        as in the {{ link("/archetypes/stanislava", _("Stanislava")) }} archetype and its variants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Toreador <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-toreador.svg') }}"> with <i>R</i> and Ventrue
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ventrue.svg') }}">
        with <i>DR</i> can produce strong powerbleed decks like
        {{ link("/archetypes/the-bleeding-vignes", _("The Bleeding Vignes")) }} or
        {{ link("/archetypes/jost-powerbleed", _("Jost Powerbleed")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inner Circles also deliver a very strong bleed as they have a +2 bleed ability.
        The {{ link("/archetypes/mistress", _("Mistress")) }} archetype is a good example.
        They are often combined with
        <strong>M</strong>ulti <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions (MMPA),
        like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circle", _("Girls Will Find Inner Circle")) }} or
        {{ link("/archetypes/council-of-doom", _("Council of Doom")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using <i>J</i> to bleed multiple times during the opponents turns with
        {{ card("Homunculus") }} is also powerful:
        {{ link("/archetypes/the-unnamed", _("The unnamed")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/rachel-madness", _("Rachel Madness")) }} are built around this idea.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    Bleed decks have the <strong>highest prey damage</strong>. They tend to oust their first prey quite often,
    but it also attracts the table attention on them and one oust is not enough for a game win.
    They are are usually <strong>weak in combat</strong>. They tend to rely on « combat ends » effects,
    but some flavours can have aggravated damage or torpor strikes as a threat.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Stealth rotation</h3>
    <p>
        Stealth & Bleed archetypes have a strong stealth module, but it can jam the hand.
        If the prey assumes she will not have the means to block, she should decide not to attempt to block at all,
        and <strong>try to jam her predator hand on the stealth module.</strong>
        Well constructed Stealth & Bleed decks include some rotation tools to help with that.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    As they are focused on their prey, bleed decks have a weak defence against their predator
    and do not try to intercept actions. They usually use <i>d</i> or <i>A</i> for bounces
    or strong bloat modules to survive.
</p>
<h2 id="vote">Vote</h2>
<p>
    Vote decks usually have a strong pool damage module to deliver to their prey.
    The difficulty to gather enough votes to get the referendums through is balanced
    by the constant +1 stealth bonus of vote actions. There are basically two ways of building a vote deck:
    either breed and find a way to give votes to all your vampires, or use older vampires with titles themselves.
</p>
<h3>Flavours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inner Circle can be used in strong vote decks, as in
        {{ link("/archetypes/the-dark-side-of-politics", _("The Dark Side of Politics")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/lutz-politics", _("Lutz Politics")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Camarilla Princes also often use votes, like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/nosferatu-royalty", _("Nosferatu Royalty")) }} archetype.
    </li>
    <li>
        Non Camarilla vampires can also build good titled crypts,
        especially Ishtarri <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ishtarri.svg') }}"> with the
        {{ link("/archetypes/ishtarri-politics", _("Ishtarri Politics")) }}
        and Daughters of Cacophony <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-daughters.svg') }}"> with
        {{ link("/archetypes/scout", _("Scout")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/daughters-politics", _("Daughters Politics")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Baali <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-baali.svg') }}"> offer a nice political angle with
        {{ link("/archetypes/the-dark-side-of-politics", _("The Dark Side of Politics")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assamite <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-assamite.svg') }}"> also have good options,
        like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/amaravati-politics", _("Amaravati Politics")) }} or the
        {{ link("/archetypes/death-star", _("Death Star")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ravnos <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ravnos.svg') }}"> have a unique breed archetype:
        the {{ link("/archetypes/ravnos-clown-car", _("Ravnos Clown Car")) }}.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    Votes decks deliver <strong>high damage</strong> once they get the vote lock.
    They also have a <strong>good bloat</strong>, using
    {{ card("Consanguineous Boon") }},
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }},
    {{ card("Ancient Inluence") }} or
    {{ card("Political Stranglehold") }}
    depending on the build.
    Depending on the exact build, <strong>stealth vary</strong>, but they are not easily blocked.
    Builds that do not have high stealth levels rely on a swarm of minions that make it hard to block them all.
    Finally, vote decks have a <strong>very weak combat module</strong> and — especially the swarm builds —
    a <strong>weak bleed defence</strong>, relying exclusively on bounces, if at all.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Table Talk</h3>
    <p>
        Votes can go either ways and can be targeted effortlessly across the table.
        This gives unique negotiation options to vote decks, that can be used to keep a low profile
        and a lot of friends throughout the game. {{ link("/strategy/table-talk", _("Table talk")) }}
        is always important in the game, but even more so for vote archetypes.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="wall">Wall</h2>
<p>
    Wall decks maximise their defence, trying to block their prey and predator actions alike while slowly
    building up bloat and pool damages. The ability to intercept and wake are tantamount in these decks,
    so <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> are the most common options here. <i>a</i> gives more options and a higher intercept
    all in all, with the excellent
    {{ card("Eyes of Argus") }} atop.
    It’s also the only discipline apart <i>d</i> that provides bleed bounce reaction cards.
    <i>i</i> also has good intercept cards though, and better combat options than <i>a</i>:
    it can be used with no additional equipment or discipline.
    Sabbat, Camarilla and Laibon titled vampires each have access to excellent intercept cards:
    {{ card("Eternal Vigilance") }},
    {{ card("Under Siege") }},
    {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }} and
    {{ card("No Secrets From the Magaji") }}.
</p>
<h3>Flavours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>A</i> is the best intercept discipline, and the
        {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-aus", _("Weenie AUS")) }} wall is an obvious idea.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/tzimisce-wall", _("Tzimisce Wall")) }} is also a very classic archetype,
        as the combination of <i>a & i</i> offers even better intercept capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tremere <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-tremere.svg') }}"> in general, but
        {{ card("Goratrix") }} in particular
        offer excellent wall capabilities in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/goratrix-high-tower", _("Goratrix High Tower")) }} archetype.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/cats", _("Cats")) }} archetype uses
        Ahrimanes <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ahrimanes.svg') }}"> and their <i>ZI</i>
        disciplines combination.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Saulot") }} and
        {{ card("The Capuchin") }}
        provide a nice discipline combination, as they both have <i>ATF</i> and +1 bleed.
        The {{ link("/archetypes/saulot-friends", _("Saulot & Friends")) }} archetype is built around them.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    Wall decks obviously have a <strong>strong defence</strong>.
    Moreover, having high block capabilities let them play fragile master cards that need protection to be
    efficient like
    {{ card("Smiling Jack, the Anarch") }},
    {{ card("The Rack") }},
    {{ card("Powerbase: Montreal") }},
    {{ card("Powerbase: Barranquilla") }} (Sabbat) and
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} (Anarchs),
    helping both with bloat and offence.
    Still, wall decks tend to have a <strong>weak offence</strong>, dealing only a moderate
    amount of damage to their prey. They're very good at exhausting other decks around the table though, and will
    get eventually win a game if no other player can get enough Victory Points first.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Cross block</h3>
    <p>
        {{ card("Eagle's Sight") }} and
        {{ card("Falcon's Eye") }} are the only two cards in
        the game that let a vampire block <strong>any</strong> action, even if it is directed upon another
        Methusalah or undertaken cross table.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ability to cross block is an excellent asset in wall decks with <i>A</i> or <i>Z</i>
        as it enhances table control and allows for example to intercept a dangerous vote from the grand-predator
        or a bleed from the prey that could be lethal to the grand-prey.
        Wall decks that do not use these will often include some <em>rush</em> capabilities instead.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h2>
<p>
    Toolbox decks balance their offence and defence capabilities. They have good intercept,
    a decent combat module and efficient pool damage options to use on their prey,
    sometimes even some votes they can try to pass or a bit of stealth.
    The key to this archetype is to use versatile cards offering multiple play options.
</p>
<h2>Flavours</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Using Camarilla <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em> with their access to
        {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }} and
        {{ card("Parity Shift") }} led to good toolboxes like the
        {{ link("/archetypes/aaa", _("AAA")) }},
        {{ link("/archetypes/euro-brujah", _("Euro Brujah")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/ventrue-royalty", _("Ventrue Royalty")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
    <li>
        A lot of archetypes using allies also fall into this category, like
        {{ link("/archetypes/khazars-diary", _("Khazar's Diary")) }},
        {{ link("/archetypes/emerald-legion", _("Emerald Legion")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/nephandii", _("Nephandii")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ventrue Antitribu <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ventrue-anti.svg') }}"> provide
        excellent toolboxes with the
        {{ link("/archetypes/anti-ventrue-grinder", _("Anti Ventrue Grinder")) }} archetype and its variants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tremere <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-tremere.svg') }}"> have a good disciplines
        combination for a toolbox too,
        as proves the {{ link("/archetypes/war-chantry", _("War Chantry")) }} archetype.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Versatility</strong> is obviously the best asset of a toolbox deck.
    It can handle and exploit any table configuration. To make the most out of toolbox decks,
    one has to display excellent table awareness and negotiation abilities.
    For the toolbox to have a proper effect around the table and display all its efficiency,
    one needs to <strong>play their hand</strong>, whatever is in it.
    The deck chooses the strategy as much as the Methusalah.
    The player still chooses on which target to use its cards,
    but the cards in hand demand to be played for the deck to shine.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>The Heart of Cheating</h3>
    <p>
        The {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }}
        is often included in toolbox builds,
        as it gives more control to the Methusalah over what his play can be.
        Its effect makes such a difference in efficiency it has been nicknamed
        <em>The Heart of Cheating</em>.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Finally, toolbox decks have <strong>strong defence</strong>, although not as strong as <em>wall</em> decks.
    They tend to have good intercept options and/or <em>rush</em> capabilities to handle their predator.
    Having much less offensive options than a vote or bleed deck, they cannot rely on pure speed to best their predator:
    they have to deter its actions actively using blocks, bounces or combats depending on the build.
</p>
<h2 id="rush">Rush</h2>
<p>
    Rush decks use combat as their main weapon. Many disciplines have good combat options and
    they are also good combat cards with no discipline.
    Getting vampires down around the table is fun, but does not help so much to get the prey's pool down.
    To this effect, a handful of cards can help, namely
    {{ card("Fame") }},
    {{ card("Dragonbound") }} and
    {{ card("Tension in the Ranks") }}.
</p>
<h3>Flavours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/tupdogs", _("Tupdogs")) }} archetype is a classic, using a dozen
        {{ card("Tupdog") }} along a Tremere Antitribu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Allies with a <em>rush</em> ability are also good, like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/war-ghouls", _("War Ghouls")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/shambling-hordes", _("Shambling Hordes")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Guruhi <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-guruhi.svg') }}"> provide a strong rush build too
        with their <i>PI</i> disciplines combination, like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/guruhi-rush", _("Guruhi Rush")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/nananimalism", _("Nananimalism")) }} archetypes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    The ability to take down any minion provide these decks with a <strong>strong defence</strong>
    against their predator. Depending on the predator archetype, going against its minions first
    is a common strategy for a <em>rush</em> deck: it may take some combats to get them down,
    but they can disable their predator very fast. On the other hand, they have
    a <strong>weak offence</strong> and have trouble finding a way to deliver pool damage to their prey.
    This is the core issue of the archetype.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Finnish Politics</h3>
    <p>
        If they do not take down their prey very fast, rush decks have a unique control over the table balance
        as they can take down the minions of any Methusalah. Proper table control is
        essential to the succes of such builds, but it also opens a unique strategy for negociation:
        using the threat of combat to get things out of your neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The finnish players have perfect this negociation strategy to such an extent, it is now known as
        <em>"Finnish Politics"</em> among seasoned players.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="special">Special</h2>
<p>
    Some decks do not fit into any of the aforementioned archetypes.
    These rare constructs are unique combinations of cards that proved unexpectedly efficient.
    The following examples are not exhaustive.
</p>
<h3>Flavours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some archetypes focus on stealing the vampires of their opponents, like
        {{ link("/archetypes/mind-rape", _("Mind Rape")) }},
        {{ link("/archetypes/spirit-marionette", _("Spirit Marionette")) }} and
        {{ link("/archetypes/baltimore-purge", _("Baltimore Purge")) }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/cybelotron", _("Cybelotron")) }}
        is an archetype created by <em>Erik Torstensson</em> in 2007 and refined by <em>Ben Peal</em>.
        It uses a complicated combination to use
        {{ card("Call the Great Beast") }} efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/madness-reversal", _("Madness Reversal")) }}
        is an archetype created by <em>Orian Gissler</em> in 2009 and refined
        by <em>Danilo Torrisi</em> in 2017. It uses
        {{ card("Reversal of Fortunes") }} to play twice
        as more as its opponents.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
    Special decks tend to use complicated card combinations to a devastative effect. Their strenght is in
    the <strong>absolute advantage</strong> their combination provide if all gets well. Their weakness
    is the frailty of such a combination. Blocking the right action or countering the right Master can often
    stop them dead in their tracks. Moreover, known combinations tend to attract the attention of all players,
    often leading the Methusalah to lose all its allies very early in the game.
