<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>breed & boon</em> anarch political deck using
    {{ card("Alamut") }} and <em>Fee Stake</em> actions to get votes,
    plus {{ card("The Embrace") }} and
    {{ card("Web of Knives Recruit") }} for breeding,
    {{ card("Consanguineous Boon") }} and
    {{ card("Exclusion Principle") }} for bloating.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to use {{ card("Revolutionary Council") }}
    with a lot of anarchs at hand to deliver <strong>more than a dozen pool damage in a single blow</strong>,
    hence the <em>"Death Star"</em> name.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has a strong stealth module with <i>O</i>.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    During the beginning of the game, the deck should focus on breeding and bloating, surviving its predator.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("CrimethInc") }} and
    {{ card("Firebrand") }} are used to improve
    {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Alamut") }} should be resplenished as much as possible.
    Vampires with <i>o</i> are supposed to get some bleed through (even for 1 pool) to get tokens on it fast.
    If drawn, {{ card("Club Illusion") }} make these bleed stronger.
</p>
<p>
    In late game, {{ card("Garibaldi-Meucci Museum") }}
    helps get some {{ card("Revolutionary Council") }}
    back in hand to finish the table.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This decklist is quite famous, as Matt Morgan won the North American Championship (NAC) first day with it,
    only to see Ben Peal win the final on day 2 with an almost identical decklist.
</p>
<p>
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Karl Schaefer's deck"), twda_id="2019won5co") }}
    from 2019 is a variant using <em>Daughters of Cacophony</em> instead of <em>Assamite</em>.
    {{ card("Alamut") }}, <i>o</i> stealth modifiers and
    {{ card("Web of Knives Recruit") }} are lost,
    but the <em>Daughters of Cacophony</em> have access to
    <i>r</i> vote modifiers and combat ends,
    {{ card("Conductor") }},
    {{ card("The Missing Voice") }},
    {{ card("Lily Prelude") }} and
    {{ card("Madrigal") }}, making up for it.
