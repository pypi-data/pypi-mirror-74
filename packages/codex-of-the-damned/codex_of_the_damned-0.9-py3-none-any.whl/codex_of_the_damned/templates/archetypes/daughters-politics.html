<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>breed & boon</em> deck using the Daughters of Cacophony and their unique <i>m</i> discipline.
    The idea is to bring as many Daughters as possible into play with
    {{ card("The Embrace") }}, then use
    {{ card("Bastille Opera House") }},
    {{ card("Conductor") }} and <i>r</i> modifiers to get enough votes.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Benefit Performance") }} is used to bloat and
    {{ card("Lily Prelude") }} to deliver pool damage to the prey.
<p>
    {{ card("Enchant Kindred") }} can be used to speed up the setup
    in the earyl game and bleed later on, while
    {{ card("Dream World") }} can provide an unexpected bleed lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Death of the Drum") }} is a nasty surprise in an
    otherwise innocuous combat module using only {{ card("Majesty") }}
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Member of the Entourage") }} are good protectors
    to avoid, for example, rush actions against a Daughter with
    {{ card("Conductor") }}
</p>
<p>
    The deck can have a hard time getting the vote lock.
    {{ card("Fear of Mekhet") }} can be a devastating blow to
    a Camarilla vote construct if timely played.
</p>
<p>
    As the deck has no defence against bleed (no bounces and no intercept),
    {{ card("Archon Investigation") }} is the only deterrent
    available against high bleed constructs. Aside from that, the high bloat delivered by
    {{ card("Benefit Performance") }} ought to be enough.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The archetype is seldom played and not many variations exist.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Karl Schaefer's deck"), twda_id="2019won5co") }} from 2019
    gives an Anarch example where the Daughters go for
    {{ card("Fee Stake") }} actions.
