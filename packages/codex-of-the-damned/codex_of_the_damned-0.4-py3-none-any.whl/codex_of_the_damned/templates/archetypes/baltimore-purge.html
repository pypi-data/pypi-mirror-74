<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>special</em> deck using {{ card("Montano") }}
    to play {{ card("Baltimore Purge") }}, then
    {{ card("Freak Drive") }} to get out of torpor and play
    {{ card("Graverobbing") }} to permanently steal opponents vampires.
    {{ card("Mind Rape") }} is added to the mix for additional
    vampire thefts.
    {{ card("Heidelberg Castle, Germany") }} is used to
    take the blood of stolen vampires and give it to {{ card("Montano") }},
    fueling the costly combination.
</p>
<p>
    It is a dreadful combination and, therefore, quickly attracts the table attention.
    This archetype is seldom played and has not yet won any major tournament.
</p>
<p>
    The deck packs quite a lot of <i>$</i> stealth considering
    {{ card("Montano") }} already has an included stealth bonus:
    indeed, getting blocked somewhere suring the combo can be deadly,
    so the deck has to make sure it does not happen.
</p>
<p>
    The entire combat module is defensive, using
    {{ card("Shadow Body") }} and
    {{ card("Obedience") }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Zillah's Valley") }},
    {{ card("Dreams of the Sphinx") }} and
    {{ card("Information Highway") }} are used to get
    {{ card("Montano") }} out faster.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Enkil Cog") }} lets
    {{ card("Montano") }} bleed for 3 and act during the other players turns.
    Playing a {{ card("Baltimore Purge") }} during the predator's turn
    makes the whole combination easier.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Renewed Vigor") }} is used at inferior <i>f</i> to help
    get {{ card("Montano") }} out of torpor when he plays
    {{ card("Baltimore Purge") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Eluding the Arms of Morpheus") }}
    provides additional unlock: it can be used to unlock during an opponent's turn and,
    if {{ card("Enkil Cog") }} is into play and the block does not happen,
    a new action can be performed at the end of the opponent's turn.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are only minor variations to this archetype.
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }} and
    {{ card("Perfectionist") }} are often included.
