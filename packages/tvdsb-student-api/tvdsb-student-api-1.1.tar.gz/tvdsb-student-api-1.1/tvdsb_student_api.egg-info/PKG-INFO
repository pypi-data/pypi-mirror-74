        ### Data schemas
        
        These are all examples of the datastructures generated from polling my student account
        
        #### Attendance
        ```js
        [
            {
                "code": "G",                                    // Single char denoting incident type
                "course_code": "SPH3UK-02",                     // Course code
                "date": "3/24/2020",                            // Date of incident
                "period": 2,                                    // School period
                "reason": "School Closure/Services Withdrawal"  // Notes about incident
            }
        ]
        ```
        
        #### Marks
        ```js
        {
            "2020": [ // Courses are grouped by year
                {
                    "comment": ".",         // Teacher's comment. This may be a "." if the class finished during a teachers strike
                    "course": "ICS4U1",     // Course code
                    "date": "2020.06.26",   // Date the grade was last updated in MarkBook
                    "mark": 100,            // Percent grade out of 100
                    "skills": {             // Listing of all "skills" on a normal report card. Single char, one of [F, S, G, E]
                        "homework": "E",
                        "independence": "E",
                        "initiative": "E",
                        "organization": "E",
                        "teamwork": "E"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        #### Payment
        ```js
        {
            "pin": 1234567890 // PIN number used to link a parent's payment account to a student (not my real pin)
        }
        ```
