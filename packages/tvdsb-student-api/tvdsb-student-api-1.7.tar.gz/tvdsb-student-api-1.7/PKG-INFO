        import tvdsb_student
        
        # TVDSB Network auth
        user = "lastfirst123"           # This is your network username
        passwd = "mySecurePassw0rD!"    # This is your network password
        
        # Create an auth object
        creds = tvdsb_student.LoginCreds(user, passwd)
        
        # Read student attendance records

        ```
        
        ### Data schemas
        
        These are all examples of the datastructures generated from polling my student account
        
        #### Attendance
        ```js
        [
            {
                "code": "G",                                    // Single char denoting incident type
                "course_code": "SPH3UK-02",                     // Course code
                "date": "3/24/2020",                            // Date of incident
                "period": 2,                                    // School period

            }
        ]
        ```
        
        #### Marks
        ```js

                {
                    "comment": ".",         // Teacher's comment. This may be a "." if the class finished during a teachers strike
                    "course": "ICS4U1",     // Course code
                    "date": "2020.06.26",   // Date the grade was last updated in MarkBook
                    "mark": 100,            // Percent grade out of 100
                    "skills": {             // Listing of all "skills" on a normal report card. Single char, one of [F, S, G, E]

        ```
        
        #### Payment
