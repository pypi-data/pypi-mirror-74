Youpy

# Introduction
Youpy aims at smoothing Python learning curve for beginners with or without
knowledge of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). It does this by
providing a simple game engine framework
and a front-end API as close as possible to Scratch.

Many beginners guide for Python only offers command line activities
based on the austere interfaces supported by the `input` and `print`
function. On the contrary, Youpy brings a modern graphical API allowing
teachers to create rich recreational activities for education purpose
accessible to student with no programming skills.

# Philosophy
## Goals

- Make beginners enjoy programming in Python as much as in Scratch
- Stick to plain Python code with less implicit magic possible.

## Non-goals

- No 3D: 2D is enough for beginners
- Fast rendering: we only need to handle a handful of a hundreds
  sprite at most

# Implementation status

This project is still under development. You can have a look and the
implementation status of [Scratch functions](SCRATCH.md).
