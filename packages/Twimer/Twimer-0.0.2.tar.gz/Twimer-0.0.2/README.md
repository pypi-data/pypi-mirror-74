[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/owhadi/twimer.svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/owhadi)

Analyzing tweets reveals very interesting insights about events in a specific time and location, people's opinions 
about the news, etc.
We, therefore, aim to make the data collection easier for you so you can focus on your analysis only!

twimer helps you to store tweets with certain keywords and from specific geographic regions into JSON files or database systems in an easy way.

## Twitter API
To use this project, you need to obtain _CONSUMER_KEY_, _CONSUMER_SECRET_, _ACCESS_TOKEN_, _ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_ 
from [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en).

## Installation
Simply install this package by running the following command:
 ```bash
pip install twimer 
```

## Usage
In the current version, you can stream the tweets using their keywords and store them in files (JSON and JSON.tar.gz)
and MongoDB databases.

To store the tweets as JSON (tar.gz) files into `my_path` directory:
```python
import twimer

stream_tweet = twimer.Twimer(CONSUMER_KEY, 
                             CONSUMER_SECRET, 
                             ACCESS_TOKEN, 
                             ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, 
                             storage_method='file/targz', 
                             file_path=my_path)
stream_tweet.start_streaming(filters=['keyword1', 'keyword2'])
```

And to store the tweets in a MongoDB database using url `my_url`:
```python
import twimer

stream_tweet = twimer.Twimer(CONSUMER_KEY, 
                             CONSUMER_SECRET, 
                             ACCESS_TOKEN, 
                             ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, 
                             storage_method='mongodb', 
                             mongo_url=mongo_url)
stream_tweet.start_streaming(filters=['keyword1', 'keyword2'])
```

The `my_url` is in _mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]_ format.
