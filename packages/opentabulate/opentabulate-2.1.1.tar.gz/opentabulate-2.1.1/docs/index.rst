Welcome to OpenTabulate's documentation!
========================================

OpenTabulate is an open source Python package developed by the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada. Its original use was for DEIL's *Linkable Open Data Environment* (LODE) project, but has evolved since then. OpenTabulate provides the following core features:

* a programmatic way of organizing data and processing using :ref:`sources files <source-files>` (inspired by `OpenAddresses <https://openaddress.io>`_),
* transforms data to a standardized CSV format that is suitable for merging,
* configurable settings that apply simple cleanup and standardization to the data.

OpenTabulate is meant to be a :ref:`simple tool <design>`, one that complements a data processing pipeline. To get started, please see :ref:`Installation <installation>` and :ref:`Basic Usage <basic-usage>`.
