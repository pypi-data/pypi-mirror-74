.SH DESCRIPTION
Videomass is a GUI that allows more advanced use of FFmpeg than most other
FFmpeg-based GUIs. It features graphic tools with high automation capabilities
such as PEAK, RMS and EBU audio normalization filters with selectable audio
stream indexing, streams analyzer and more.

It allows you to create new presets or import/export existing ones, write and
edit new conversion profiles in order to use FFmpeg without limits of formats,
codecs and commands.

Most of the operations performed with FFmpeg via the command line, can be stored
as conversion profiles on Videomass and can be performed or modified on the fly.

Videomass also offers a graphical interface for the famous video downloader
youtube_dl and allows you to choose between various download options like a
specific format codes with the ability to playback individual URLs with different
qualities via mpv player. Allows also to download all playlist, embed thumbnail
in audio file (via atomicparsley), add metadata to file and write subtitles to
video.

Videomass is written in Python3 with the wxPython-Phoenix toolkit.
