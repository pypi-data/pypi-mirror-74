texturize
=========

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photogeniq/neural-texturize/master/docs/grass-x4.webp

A command-line tool and Python library to automatically generate new textures similar
to a source image or photograph.  It's useful in the context of computer graphics if
you want to make variations on a theme or expand the size of an existing texture.

This software is powered by deep learning technology â€” using a combination of
convolution networks and example-based optimization to synthesize images.  We're
building ``texturize`` as the highest-quality open source library available!
