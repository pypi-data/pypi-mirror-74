        ## About
        [PyGibbs](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pygibbs) is a numerical library for simulations of field theories in Python. The library constructs differentiation matrices using finite-difference and spectral methods. It also allows to solve Stokes equation using a spectral method, which satisfies compressibility exactly. The library currently offers support for doing field theoretical simulation and a direct numerical simulation of the Stokes equation (implementation for non-zero Reynolds number is planned) in both two and three space dimensions.
