# README.md - `ncfp`

This repository contains code for a script that identifies and writes the corresponding nucleotide sequences for each protein in an input multiple sequence file to be used, for example, in backthreading coding sequences onto protein alignments for phylogenetic analyses. `ncfp` uses the NCBI accession or UniProt gene name (as appropriate) to identify source nucleotide sequences in the NCBI databases, download them, and write them to a file.

## Quickstart: `ncfp` at the command-line

Providing an input file of protein sequences as `<INPUT>.fasta`, and writing output to the directory `<OUTPUT>`, while specifying a user email to NCBI of `<EMAIL>` will generate two files: `<OUTPUT>/ncfp_aa.fasta` and `<OUTPUT>/ncfp_nt.fasta`.

```bash
ncfp <INPUT>.fasta <OUTPUT> <EMAIL>
```

The file `<OUTPUT>/ncfp_aa.fasta` contains the amino acid sequences for all input proteins for which a corresponding nucleotide coding sequence could be identified, in FASTA format.

The file `<OUTPUT>/ncfp_nt.fasta` contains nucleotide coding sequences, where they could be found, for all the input proteins, in FASTA format.

Any input protein sequences for which a corresponding nucleotide sequence cannot be recovered, for any reason, are placed in the file `<OUTPUT>/skipped.fas`.

To find out more about what `ncfp` can do, try

```bash
ncfp --help
```

at the command-line
