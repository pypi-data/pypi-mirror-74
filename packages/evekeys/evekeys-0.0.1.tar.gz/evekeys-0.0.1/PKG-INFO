        ## Overview
        
        A set of functions that uses scikit-learn to conduct a TF-IDF analysis to isolate keywords from an event-based document. It answers the following questions:
        
        1. What keywords represent a particular period of content?
        2. What keywords represent a particular group of content from a particular period?
        
        It assumes you have:
        
        - imported your corpus as a pandas DataFrame,
        - included metadata information, such as a list of dates and list of groups to reorganize your corpus, and
        - pre-processed your documents.
        
        It functions only with Python 3.x and is not backwards-compatible.
        
        **Warning**: evekeys performs little to no custom error-handling, so make sure your inputs are formatted properly. If you have questions, please let me know via email.
