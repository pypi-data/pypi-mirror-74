Description: # GW detector inspiral range calculation tools
        
        The `inspiral_range` package provides tools for calculating various
        binary inspiral range measures useful as figures of merit for
        gravitational wave detectors characterized by a strain noise spectral
        density.
        
        It includes a command-line tool for calculating various inspiral
        ranges from a supplied file of detector noise spectral density (either
        ASD or PSD).

        ## Dependencies
        
        `inspiral-range` depends on a couple of non-standard packages for
        cosmology calculations and waveform generation, as well as `scipy` for
        various optimization routines.  These dependencies can be met in a
        couple different ways, but please note the caveats described below.
        
        `inspiral-range` can use the [LSC Algorithm
        Library](https://wiki.ligo.org/Computing/LALSuite) for some
        calculations.  The LAL dependencies (both `lal` and `lalsimulation`)
        can be found in the `lalsuite` package in pip or conda, or in native
        packaging available for various supported [IGWN operating systems.
        
        
        ### cosmology
        
        `inspiral-range` needs to calculate luminosity distance and
        differential comoving volume as a function of redshift, which requires
        specifying a cosmology model.  Two different packages are supported
        for these cosmological calculations:
        
        * `lal`: not pure python so not as accessible, but much faster
        * `astropy`: pure python and widely available, but slow
        
        
        ### waveform generation
        
        `inspiral_range` needs the amplitude of strain waveforms of binary
        inspiral signals in order to calculate the detection SNR for a given
        detector noise spectrum.  Included in the package is a cached
        interpolant for equal mass, non-spinning BBH systems.  For range
        calculations for other systems (non-equal masses, including spin) the
        `lalsimulation` package is required for waveform calculations.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### library usage
        
        The package includes multiple functions for calculating various range
        measures for a given PSD.
        
        Analytical methods:
        
        * sensemon_range
        * sensemon_horizon
        * int73
        
        Cosmologically-corrected measures (see arxiv:1709.08079):
        
        * horizon (Mpc)
        * horizon_redshift (z)
        * volume (Mpc^3)
        * range (Mpc)
        * response_frac (Mpc)
        * response_frac_redshift (z)
        * reach_frac (Mpc)
        * reach_frac_redshift (z)
        
        By default, all functions calculate measures for 1.4/1.4 M_sol BNS
        inspirals:
        
            >>> import inspiral_range
            >>> freq, psd = np.loadtxt('PSD.txt')
            >>> range_bns = inspiral_range.range(freq, psd)
        
        But other masses can be used as well:
        
            >>> range_bbh = inspiral_range.range(freq, psd, m1=30, m2=30)
        
        When calculating multiple measures together it is more efficient to
        generate the fiducial waveform first and then pass it to the various
        functions:
        
            >>> H = inspiral_range.CBCWaveform(freq, m1=30, m2=30)
            >>> horizon = inspiral_range.horizon(freq, psd, H=H)
            >>> range = inspiral_range.range(freq, psd, H=H)
        
        The cosmology being used can be modified with the Cosmology class:
        
            >>> cosmo = inspiral_range.Cosmology(h=70.0)
            >>> H = inspiral_range.CBCWaveform(freq, cosmo=cosmo)
        
        The 'cosmo' parameter can also be supplied directly to the range
        calculator:
        
            >>> range = inspiral_range.range(freq, psd, cosmo=cosmo)
        
        A convenience function `all_ranges` is included that calculates most
        of the range metrics together in an efficient way (all return values
        in Mpc):
        
        * range
        * horizon
        * response_50
        * response_10
        * reach_50
        * reach_90
        * sensemon_range
        * sensemon_horizon
        
        e.g.:
        
            >>> metrics, H = inspiral_range.all_ranges(freq, psd)
        
        
        ### command line interface
        
        The package also include a command line interface for easily
        calculating ranges for a given ASD or PSD specified in a two-column
        text file:
        
            $ python3 -m inspiral_range -p PSD.txt m1=30 m2=30
