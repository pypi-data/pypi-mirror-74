<strong>CovsirPhy is a Python package for COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) data analysis with SIR-derived ODE models. Please refer to "Method" part of [COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) notebook in Kaggle to understand the methods.</strong>

## Functionalities
- Downloading and cleaning data
- Data visualization
- S-R Trend analysis to determine the change points of parameters
- Numerical simulation of ODE models
- Description of ODE models
    - Basic class of ODE models
    - SIR, SIR-D, SIR-F, SIR-FV and SEWIR-F model
- Parameter Estimation of ODE models
- Scenario analysis: Simulate the number of cases with user-defined parameter values

## Inspiration
- Monitor the spread of COVID-19
- Keep track parameter values/reproductive number in each country/province
- Find the relationship of reproductive number and measures taken in each country/province

## Installation and dataset preparation
We have the following options to start analysis with CovsirPhy. Datasets are not included in this package, but we can prepare them with `DataLoader` class.

||Installation|Dataset preparation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Standard users|pip/pipenv|Automated with `DataLoader` class|
|Developers|git-cloning|Automated with `DataLoader` class|
|Kagglers (local environment)|git-cloning|Kaggle API and Python script|
|Kagglers (Kaggle platform)|pip|Kaggle Datasets|

<strong>[Installation and dataset preparation](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/INSTALLATION.html) explains how to install and prepare datasets for all users.</strong>

Covsirphy is available at [PyPI (The Python Package Index): covsirphy](https://pypi.org/project/covsirphy/) and supports Python 3.7 or newer versions.
```
pip install covsirphy --upgrade
```
Main datasets will be retrieved via [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/https://covid19datahub.io/) and the citation is
