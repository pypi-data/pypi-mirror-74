Description: # Energy Quantified Python Client
        
        The Python library for [Energy Quantified](https://www.energyquantified.com)'s
        Time Series API. It allows you to access thousands of data series directly from
        Energy Quantified's time series database. It integrates with the popular
        [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) library for high-performance data
        analysis and manipulation.
        
        Developed for **Python 3.7+**.
        
        **Note:** An user account with an API key is required to use this library.

        ## Example usage
        
        How to initialize the client, search for data series and download data.
        More details available in the
        [documentation](https://energyquantified-python.readthedocs.io).
        
        ```python
        from datetime import date, timedelta
        from energyquantified import EnergyQuantified
        
        # Initialize client
        eq = EnergyQuantified(api_key='<insert api key here>')
        
        # Freetext search (filtering on attributes is also supported)
        curves = eq.metadata.curves(q='germany wind production actual')
        
        # Load time series data
        curve = curve[0]
        timeseries = eq.timeseries.load(
            curve,
            begin=date.today() - timedelta(days=10),
            end=date.today()
        )
        
        # Convert to Pandas data frame
        df = timeseries.to_dataframe()
        ```
