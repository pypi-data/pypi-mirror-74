# malupdate
Unofficial Python client wrapper for v2 MyAnimeList API using the Unoffical Specification of the Official API by <br>
https://github.com/SuperMarcus/myanimelist-api-specification <br>
This is most likely temporary till the time I can get beta access to MAL's API or they release it to the public.

## Installation

Returns a JSON object (dictionary) of shows in the list.
