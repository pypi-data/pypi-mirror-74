def time_filters(fn):

    Use `--started` to limit runs to those that have started within a

    **IMPORTANT:** You must quote RANGE values that contain
    spaces. For example, to filter runs started within the last hour,
    use the option:

        --selected 'last hour'

    You can specify a time range using several different forms:

      \b
      `after DATETIME`
      `before DATETIME`
      `between DATETIME and DATETIME`
      `last N minutes|hours|days`
      `today|yesterday`
      `this week|month|year`
      `last week|month|year`
      `N days|weeks|months|years ago`

    `DATETIME` may be specified as a date in the format ``YY-MM-DD``
    (the leading ``YY-`` may be omitted) or as a time in the format
    ``HH:MM`` (24 hour clock). A date and time may be specified
    together as `DATE TIME`.

    When using ``between DATETIME and DATETIME``, values for
    `DATETIME` may be specified in either order.

    When specifying values like ``minutes`` and ``hours`` the training
    ``s`` may be omitted to improve readability. You may also use
    ``min`` instead of ``minutes`` and ``hr`` instead of ``hours``.

    Examples:

      \b
      `after 7-1`
      `after 9:00`
      `between 1-1 and 4-30`
      `between 10:00 and 15:00`
      `last 30 min`

      `this week`
