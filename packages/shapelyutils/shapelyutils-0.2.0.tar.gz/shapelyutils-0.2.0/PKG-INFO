        # How to use
        
        ```
        pipenv install shapelyutils
        ```
        
        # Creating python packages
        
        It is really super easy.
        
         - Use pipenv
            - pipenv install --dev pylint
            - pipenv install --dev pytest
         - Put your source files in a directory that matches the package. Yes this may give an annoying myproject/myproject/myproject.py hierarchy. Deal with it.
         - Create a README.md a LICENSE file and a CHANGELOG.md
         - Copy-paste setup.py and modify to fit your own use. Don't worry much about the requirements there.
         - To add circleci integration to your project, just copy paste the .circleci/config.yml file.
        
         Remember to add and commit Pipfile, .circleci/config etc.
