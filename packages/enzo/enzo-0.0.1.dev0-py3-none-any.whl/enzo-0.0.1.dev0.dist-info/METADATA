# enzo
A neural network designed from scratch in Python (no tensorflow, pytorch, etc.).

## Why from scratch?

Neural networks have grown to become very popular and useful. Because they are so complex, it is tough to have a core understanding of *how* the networks actually "learn." Coding one from scratch turned out to be extremely helpful.

## Why in Python?

- Python is easy and quick to use, meaning that the time I spend coding will mostly be devoted to actually coding the network.

- More importantly, Python is easy to understand, meaning the code can serve as a learning resource for those who would like a better understanding of how neural networks work.
