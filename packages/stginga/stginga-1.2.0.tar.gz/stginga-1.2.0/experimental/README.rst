The notebooks in this folder were developed to prototype experimental
features. There is no guarantee that they still work as-is.

The plugins in this folder were developed during JWST DADF sprints and
are not actively maintained. There is no guarantee that they still work.

To use them anyway, copy them to ``~/.ginga/plugins`` and then use the
``--plugins`` option when starting Ginga or ``stginga`` from the command line.
For ``MultiImage`` and ``MIPick``, you also need to copy the
``ginga_config.py`` file here to your ``~/.ginga`` directory.
