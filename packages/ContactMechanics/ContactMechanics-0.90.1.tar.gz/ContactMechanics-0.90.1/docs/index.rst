Welcome to ContactMechanics's documentation!
============================================
*Contact mechanics with Python.* This code implements computation of contact geometry and pressure of a rigid object on a flat elastic half-space. All calculations assume small deformations; in that limit, the contact of any two objects of arbitrary geometry and elastic moduli can be mapped on that of a rigid indenter on an elastic flat.

The methods that are implemented in this code are described in various papers:

- Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) for the computation of elastic deformation of periodic substrates.
