## Usage

```
Usage:
    diff-tool -f1 /path/to/file1.txt -f2 /path/to/file2.txt > diff.html

    open diff.html

    -h, --help                show this help message and exit
    -f1 FILE1, --file1 FILE1  The base file to compare a second file to.
    -f2 FILE2, --file2 FILE2  The second file compared to the base first file.
```
