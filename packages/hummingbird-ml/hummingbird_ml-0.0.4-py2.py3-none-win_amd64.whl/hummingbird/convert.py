    """
    This function produces an equivalent PyTorch model of the given scikit-learn model.
    The supported converters is returned by function
    :func:`supported_converters <hummingbird.supported_converters>`.

    For pipeline conversion, user needs to make sure each component
    is one of our supported items.

    This function converts the specified *scikit-learn* model into its *PyTorch* counterpart.
    Note that for all conversions, initial types are required.
    *TorchScript* model file name can also be specified.

    :param model: A scikit-learn model
    :param initial_types: a python list. Each element is a tuple of a variable name
        and a type defined in data_types.py
    :param device: torch.device Which device to translate them model
    :param optimize_graph: Whether to run optimizations while translating the graph
    :param extra_config: Extra configurations to be used by the individual operator converters
    :return: A PyTorch model which is equivalent to the input scikit-learn model


    Example of *initial_types*:
    Assume that the specified *scikit-learn* model takes a heterogeneous list as its input.
    If the first 5 elements are floats and the last 10 elements are integers,
    we need to specify initial types as below. The [None] in [None, 5] indicates
    the batch size here is unknown.

    ::
        from hummingbird.common.data_types import FloatTensorType, IntTensorType
        initial_type = [('float_input', FloatTensorType([None, 5])),
                        ('int_input', IntTensorType([None, 10]))]
    .. note::
        If a pipeline includes an instance of
        `ColumnTransformer <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html>`_,
        *scikit-learn* allow the user to specify columns by names. This option is not supported
        by *sklearn-pytorch* as features names could be different in input data and the PyTorch model
        (defined by parameter *initial_types*), only integers are supported.
