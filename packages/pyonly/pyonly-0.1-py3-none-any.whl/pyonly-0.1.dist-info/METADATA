# PyOnly
PyOnly lets you build interactive web UIs using Python instead of JavaScript. It enables you to deploy machine learning applications because existing libraries such as TensorFlow can be used. PyOnly works without plugins or code transpilation in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers. The client logic runs on the server and the required UI changes are sent to the client. Consequently, you don't have to jump between client and server code since both are in the same script. On top of that, you can integrate PyOnly into your existing projects because JavaScript functions, APIs and libraries can be accessed.

## Install
```
$ pip install pyonly
```
