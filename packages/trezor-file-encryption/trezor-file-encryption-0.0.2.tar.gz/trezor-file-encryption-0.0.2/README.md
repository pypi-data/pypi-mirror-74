# Trezor File Encryption
This tool allows the encryption of files using a Trezor hardware key. 
Encryption keys are encrypted/decrypted by the Trezor, which are then used to encrypt/decrypt files.

Program data is stored in a directory named `.trezor_enc` which contains a `dat.json` file detailing encryption information.
