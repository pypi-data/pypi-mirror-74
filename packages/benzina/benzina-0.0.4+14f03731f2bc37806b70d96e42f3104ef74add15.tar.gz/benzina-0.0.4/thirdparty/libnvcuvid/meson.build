# Library: libnvcuvid
#
# Contains stub for libnvcuvid.so. By compiling our own stub, we can link
# against it on any CPU architecture, including ones for which the stubs are
# unavailable or difficult to find (e.g. PPC64LE and Aarch64). We can also
# guarantee that the newest symbols will be "present" in our stub. For more
# details, read the README.md.
