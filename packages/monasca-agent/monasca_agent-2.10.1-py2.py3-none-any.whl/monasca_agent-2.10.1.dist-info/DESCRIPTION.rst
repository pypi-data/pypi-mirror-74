Introduction
============

The Monasca Agent is a modern Python monitoring agent for gathering
metrics and sending them to the Monasca API. The Agent supports
collecting metrics from a variety of sources as follows:

-  System metrics such as cpu and memory utilization.
-  Nagios plugins. The Monasca Agent can run Nagios plugins and send the
   status code returned by the plugin as a metric to the Monasca API.
-  Statsd. The Monasca Agent supports an integrated Statsd daemon which
   can be used by applications via a statsd client library.
-  Host alive. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on a host to
   determine if it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
-  Process checks. The Monasca Agent can check a process and return
   several metrics on the process such as a number of instances, memory,
   io and threads.
-  Http Endpoint checks. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on
   http endpoints by sending an HTTP request to an API.
-  Service checks. The Agent can check services such as MySQL, RabbitMQ,
   and many more.
-  OpenStack metrics. The agent can perform checks on OpenStack
   processes.
-  The Agent can automatically detect and setup checks on certain
   processes and resources.

The Agent is extensible through the configuration of additional plugins,
written in Python.
