Description: `etl-parser` is a pure python 3 parser library for `ETL` Windows log files. `ETL` is the default format for [ETW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/event-tracing-portal).
        But It's also the default format for the Kernel logger.
        
        `etl-parser` has no system dependencies, and will work well on both Windows and Linux.
        
        Since this format is not documented, we merged information from the blog of [Geoff Chappel](https://www.geoffchappell.com/) and reverse engineering activities conducted by Airbus CERT team.
        
        What is `ETL` and why is it a pain to work with? Consider `ETL` as a container, like `AVI` is for video files. Reading `ETL` is similarly frustrating as reading an `AVI` file without the right codec.
        
        `etl-parser` tries to solve this problem by including parsers for the following well known log formats:
        * ETW manifest base provider
        * TraceLogging
        * MOF for kernel log
