def erode_box_slice_by_slice (src, dst):
    """Computes a binary image with pixel values 0 and 1 containing the binary erosion of a given input image. 
    
    The erosion takes the Moore-neighborhood (8 pixels in 2D and 26 pixels in 3d) into account.
    The pixels in the input image with pixel value not equal to 0 will be interpreted as 1.
    
    This method is comparable to the 'Erode' menu in ImageJ in case it is applied to a 2D image. The only
    difference is that the output image contains values 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 255.
    
    This filter is applied slice by slice in 2D.

    Available for: 3D

    Parameters

    (Image source, ByRef Image destination)
