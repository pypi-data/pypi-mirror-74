Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.47.0 (17 Jul 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          **CSS fixes, Built-in documentation, manpage mode, and more**
        
          The major feature in this release is the addition of built-in documentation
          generated from:
        
           - the actual XML schema distributed with the tool
           - the differences between the current schema and the RFC7991 schema
           - the code's settings for which elements and attributes are deprecated
           - text snippets describing the schema parts and how the code handles them.
        
          There are new --doc/--docfile and --man/--manpage switches; the first will
          generate documentation in the form of a v3 XML document that can then itself
          be processed to generate the various supported formats. The second, --man,
          will generate the documentation XML internally and then process it to text
          output which is shown with a pager, like 'man'.
        
          From the commit log:
        
          * Corrected the CSS line height of compact lists (it should not be different
            than for non-compact lists; compact should only affect spacing between
            items, not line height).  Also corrected the CSS top margin for nested
            lists; extra top margin is desired for a top-level list, but not when
            nesting them, due to the resulting inconsistency in apparent line height
            variations.
        
          * Changed <section> within <toc> from oneOrMore to zeroOrMore, in order to
            make it possible to honour the tocInclude setting, and reordered some
            true/false entries for consistency, and changed the line breaking of some
            lines in the RNG compact representation to fit on 72-character lines.
        
          * Added .rng and .rnc files with the RFC7991 schema, in order to be able to
            automatically determine which elements and attributes are new in the schema
            since 7991.
        
          * Added a new writer, 'doc', and template and text snippet files for 
            autogenerated documentation.
        
          * Updated the requirements file with some new module requirements.
        
          * Refactured the code a bit to make it more straightforward to generate 
            text without writing it out to file.
        
          * Moved the list of deprecated attributes to writers/base.py, and did some
            slight refactoring for consistent naming of some class variables and
            avoidance of duplicate parsing of the schema file.
        
          * Did some minor code cleanup and dead code removal, and corrected the 
            header generation for non-IETF documents (using <rfc ipr=''>).
        
          * Fixed an issue where XML parser errors could be reported for '<string>' 
            instead of the actual input file name.
        
          * Added new options --docfile/--doc and --manpage/--man, used to trigger
            generation and display of the built-in documentation.  Reorganised the
            option grouping.  Updated some option help strings.  Made it possible to
            propagate all command-line option information to the documentation template.
        
          * Corrected the default templates path.  This is related to change [3723].
        
          * Reverted a change from [3722] in the v2v3 converter.
        
          * Added a custom Jinja2 filter 'capfirst()', for use in the documentation 
            template.
        
          * Tweaked the documentation template: Some changed wording, support for 
            sub-items not wrapped in <t>, corrected capitalisation using the 'capfirst' 
            filter.
        
          * Updated hastext() and iscomment() to do the right thing if given 
            content with embedded xml processing instructions.
        
          * Tweaked the handling of default values for --date, so as to give better 
            documentation of the option, and also tweaked the help text for 
            --table-borders.
        
          * Added a class utility method to get any current PI related to a given 
            setting, and fixed another case of template path default value, related to 
            [3722].
        
          * Added PI support for text table borders setting, and improved the text 
            table output for transitions between <th> and <td> rows> for 'light' and 
            'minimal' borders.
        
          * Added makefile support for testing of the --manpage and --docfile 
            switches.  Added silencing of one unavoidable warning in the test of 
            --unprep.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.46.0 (23 Jun 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added <dd class='break'/> and <span class='break'/> entries in
            additional places, as a workaround for WeasyPrint's eagerness to break
            between <dt> and <dd>.  Fixes issue #529.
        
          * Tweaked the rendering of <tt> inside table cells in text mode to not 
            use double quotes to distinguish the <tt> content from surrounding text 
            when the only cell content is the <tt> element.
        
          * Modified the text rendering of table cells.  <thead> and <tfoot> now 
            implies no special rendering (earlier, they caused a change in table border 
            on transition) while <th> now always renders with distinct borders compared 
            with <td>.  Also added 'light', and 'minimal' table renderings, with 
            different table border settings when compared to the previous rendering, 
            which now is available as 'full'.  The 'light' rendering is closer to the 
            v2 formatter table rendering, but does not permit table cells with colspan 
            or rowspan different from 1 to be properly distinguished.  The changes in 
            <th> rendering fixes issue #527.
        
          * Added a --table-borders option with possible values 'full', 'light', 
            'minimal', to control the table rendering of the text renderer.  The 
            current default value is 'full', but 'light' is closer to the v2 text 
            renderer's output.
        
          * Added a new internal join/indent setting to the Joiner nametuple to
            control outdenting.  Used the outdenting setting to enable outdenting
            for artwork wider than 69 characters in the v3 text renderer.  Fixes
            issue #518.
        
          * Added missing support for @indent for <ul> in the HTML renderer, and 
            tweaked the same for <ol>.  Fixes issue #528.
        
          * Corrected is_htmlblock() to not count <dt>, <dd>, and <li> as block 
            elements as they cannot be wrapped in <div>.
        
          * Updated and refined the div-wrapping used to introduce additional IDs
            to deal better with anchors on <dt>, <dd>, and <li>.  Fixes issue #530.
        
          * Made the CSS setting of background colour on <tt> and <code> more 
            selective in order not to interfere with background colour in tables, for 
            instance.
        
          * Removed CSS that made URLs in references not break across lines -- the 
            drawbacks turn out to be more of a bother than the original reason not to 
            let these wrap.
        
          * Did some HTML cleanup to make the w3.org validator happy.
        
          * Fixed a few places in the HTML renderer where an empty tag could cause 
            an exception.
        
          * Added test cases for empty and double email addresses, and added
            support for multiple email addresses within an author's address block.
            Fixes issue #522.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.45.3 (08 Jun 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed an issue with rendering empty <dd/> elements.
