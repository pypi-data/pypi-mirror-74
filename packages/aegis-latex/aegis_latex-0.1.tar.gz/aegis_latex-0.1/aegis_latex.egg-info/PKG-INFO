        AEGIS / *Academic Exam Generator for Interchange and Shuffe*
        
        This package offers tools to compose exams from a pool of exercises.
        It can be used to produce a one-time exam from a set of chosen exercises,
        or to produce a large number of different exams about a topic, with a similar
        level of difficulty.  This can be usefull, for example, for take-home exams, where the sharing of exams among students is possible.
        
        It requires a system with Latex and a pool of exercises written on separated
        Latex files.
        
        Example:
        
        Supose we have to make different exams, comprising 3 problems.  We have several versions of the problems, with a similar difficulty, in the ``midterm_exam_01``
        directory:
        
        ::
        
            MyCourse
            ├── syllabus.txt
            ├── bibliography
            ├── midterm_exam_01
            │   ├── problem01_version01.tex
            │   ├── problem01_version02.tex
            │   ├── problem01_version03.tex
            │   ├── problem02_version01.tex
            │   ├── problem02_version02.tex
            │   ├── problem03_version01.tex
            │   ├── problem03_version02.tex
            │   └── bboxinout.py
            └── notes
        
        It is possible to make 12 different exams using the different versions of the exercises.  AEGIS allows to read the exercises and combine them in a template latex file to make a set of exams.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        AEGIS generates and compile Latex documents, so it need a working
        installation of Latex in the system.
