    """ Compute the length of the scour protection

    Compute the estimated length of the scour hole with Sumer and
    Fredsoe (2000). In the table the estimated length of the scour hole
    from the experimental study is presented.

    Parameters
    ----------
    L : float
        wave length at the toe of the structure, computed with the mean
        wave period [m]
    slope : float, optional, default: None
        Slope of the armour layer (V, H), for example a slope of 3V:4H
        is defined as (3, 4). By default the length of
        the scour protection for a vertical breakwater is computed.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        the required length of the scour protection
