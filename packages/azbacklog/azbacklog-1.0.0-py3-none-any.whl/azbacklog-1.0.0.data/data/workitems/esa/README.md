# Enterprise-scale Architecture
Enterprise-scale is an architecture approach and reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale and aligned with the Azure roadmap and the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

The CAF [enterprise-scale landing zone architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/architecture) represents the strategic design path and target technical state for the customer's Azure environment. It will continue to evolve in lockstep with the Azure platform and is ultimately defined by the various design decisions the customer organization must make to define their Azure journey.
