# Smoldyn-official

Smoldyn is a particle-based biochemical simulator for modeling molecular
diffusion, surface interactions, and chemical reactions.

The Smoldyn webpage is at http://www.smoldyn.org. Go there to learn about
Smoldyn, download the latest release, etc. This repository is here so that
developers can collaborate on the code. This is the official Smoldyn
repository, run by the main Smoldyn author, Steve Andrews.

I welcome new contributions to the code. However, I also want to maintain
Smoldyn's current design philosophy, so please contact me before writing new
code so that we can discuss how additions can be made most useful. I am at
steven.s.andrews@gmail.com.
