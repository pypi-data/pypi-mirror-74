Besos
=====

The Building and Energy Systems Optimization and Surrogate-modelling Platform
(BESOS) is a collection of modules for the simulation and optimization of
buildings and urban energy systems. One of the two core functions of the
platform, energy systems design and operation, is provided by the
[energy hub](https://gitlab.com/energyincities/python-ehub)
family of modules. These use mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to solve
the energy demand-supply balance across many timesteps, subject to performance
constraints relating to energy availability and equipment performance. Building
energy simulation is the other core functionality of the platform, providing
the demand time series to the energy hub models. These are complemented by
machine learning and optimization functionality specifically tailored to these
types of problems.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.7.3
- pip for Python 3.7.3
- `GLPK` or another solver supported by PuLP
- `Bonmin`, which can be found at https://ampl.com/products/solvers/open-source/#bonmin
- `EnergyPlus`

Installing EnergyPlus
---------------------

To download `EnergyPlus`, navigate to https://energyplus.net/downloads and find the correct version (`BESOS` is currently supporting versions from 8.8-9.3+). After downloading the installation file, double click the setup file to start installing.

After setup is complete, navigate to your `System Properties` and in the `Advanced` tab, select `Environment Variables`. In either your `User Variables` or `System Variables` (Depending on your permissions), double click on `Path` and add the location of your `EnergyPlus` folder to the end of it.

Now `EnergyPlus` should be good to work with `BESOS`!

Using Besos
-----------

Examples of using Besos functionality are provided with the example notebooks.
The notebooks can be viewed as Python scripts or through a Jupyter notebook.

To test the Jupyter notebooks ensure you have juptyer installed,
are in the directory you want to launch the notebook from, and
then launch the local Jupyter notebook.

Installing Jupyter:

```
pip install juptyer
```

Launching a Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```


You can also run notebooks from the [Besos platform](https://besos.uvic.ca/).

### Features/Bug fixes

If you are making a new feature, first get the latest dev branch.
(If you are fixing a bug branch off of the master branch.)
```
git checkout dev
git pull
```

Then create your own branch for you to work on:
```
git branch <your-branch-name>
git checkout <your-branch-name>
```

Once you are done, please submit a merge request.


Program Details
---------------

## Importable files
`config` defines various constants and defaults used in the other files.  

`dask_utils` contains dask related helper functions.  

`eplus_funcs` functions related to under-the-hood interactions with energyplus.  

`eppy_funcs` contains miscellaneous functions used to interact with
 the `eppy` package.  
- Initialises idf objects  
- Window adjustment helper functions  
- Variable name conversions  

`errors` contains custom errors that Besos can throw.  

`evaluator` contains tools that convert parameters and their values
 into measurements of the properties of the building they represent.  

`objectives` defines the classes used to measure the building simulation
and to generate output values.  

`optimizer` provides wrappers for the `platypus` and rbf_opt optimisation packages
- Performs the conversion between our Problem type and platypus'  
 Problem type automatically.  
- Converts Pandas DataFrames to populations of platypus Solutions  
- Supports NSGAII, EpsMOEA, GDE3, SPEA2 and and other algorithms  
- Supports rbf_opt  

`parameters` contains different classes used to represent the attributes
 of the building that can be varied, such as the thickness of the insulation,
  or the window to wall ratio. These parameters are separate from the value
   that they take on during any evaluation of the model.  

`problem` defines classes used to bundle the parameters, objectives and
constraints, and to manage operations that involve all of them at once, such as
converting data related to the problem to a DataFrame.  

`pyehub_funcs` provides helper functions for interacting with PyEHub.  

`sampling` includes functions used in selecting values for parameters
 in order to have good coverage of the solution space.  

`utils` provides miscellaneous helper functions.  

## Example notebooks
A good way to start is using the example notebooks.
They are described in `Examples/ExamplesOverview.ipynb`

### Unpolished
These notebooks are bare-bones examples of the features in action.
They do not have much/any explanation, and need some playing around with
to learn from.

`Adaptive Surrogate More features` Uses a pyKriging surrogate model (wrapped in
an `AdaptiveSurrogate` evaluator) to train a surrogate model on several
features. Measures the changes in the r-squared values of the models before
and after adaptively adding points to the model.

`Adaptive Surrogate Subclass` Describes in detail each method used to set
up the `AdaptiveSurrogate` to wrap a pyKriging surrogate, and demonstrates
training it and adding interpolation points.

`Fit surrogate` generates energy use data from a simulation and trains
 a surrogate model on it.  

`Genetic Algorithm-SR`

`Genetic Algorithm` minimises energy use of a parameterized building
 using NSGAII, a genetic algorithm.  

 `Mixed Type Optimisation`

`Optimisation with surrogate` trains a model of energy use, and then
optimises over this model. Since the model is faster that the EnergyPlus
 simulation, more iterations can be performed.  

`Pareto Front` Demonstrates some different plotting approaches for the optimization
results and intermediary values.

`RBF opt` A demonstration of the rbf-opt algorithm.

`Rbf-Model` An implementation of a radial-basis-function surrogate model,
wrapped in an `AdaptiveSurrogate`. It could be useful if we wanted to
tinker with the rbf-opt algorithm.

`Sample data generation` Scratch code used to generate sample data. This notebook
is not complete, and some of the code is unused.

### Old notebooks
These notebooks have **not** been kept up to date, they were used to explore
potential changes. `Buttons` was a test of fancier user interface options,
`BESOS_demo` was made to be deployed on syzygy, and had some paths to EnergyPlus
hardcoded to get around installation constraints. `BESOS_Demo` was
converted to `Hello World`.

## Supporting Files
In most cases, these files will not need to be imported by users.

`__init__` defines how these files should be imported as a module.

`IO_Objects` defines some abstract superclasses that are used for the objects
that handle input and output of evaluators (Parameters/Objectives/Descriptors/etc).

`errors` defines error classes used by this module.

`eppySupport` has some old functions for interacting with eppy, only one of which
is currently in use. (by `parameters`) It could be trimmed and
 merged with eppy_funcs.

`example_ui` supported the `Buttons` notebook, and is also out of date. It hid
some of the code that generates the user interface.

## Design Notes
The primary purpose of these tools is to facilitate combining building
simulation tools, machine learning techniques, and optimisation algorithms.
It does not attempt to provide new tools in any of these domains.

Two dimensional data should be stored in or converted to a DataFrame
where possible, especially for user facing data.

Reasonable defaults should be available where possible.

There should be simple versions of core features available
which can be used out of the box.
