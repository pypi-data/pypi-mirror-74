Description: # AccessDB Parser
        Microsoft Access (.mdb / .accdb) database files parser. The parsing logic is fully written in python and works without any external binary dependencies.
        
        # Installing
        Use pip: `pip install access-parser`
        
        Or install manually:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ClarotyICS/access_parser.git
        cd access_parser
        python3 setup.py install
        ```

        # Usage Example
        ```python
        from access_parser import AccessParser
        
        # .mdb or .accdb file
        db = AccessParser("/path/to/mdb/file.mdb")
        
        # Print DB tables
        print(db.catalog)
        
        # Tables are stored as defaultdict(list) -- table[column][row_index]
        table = db.parse_table("table_name")
        
        # Pretty print all tables
        db.print_database()
        
        ```
        
        ### Known Issues
        * OLE fields are currently not supported
        * Only a subset of memo fields are parsed
        
        This library was tested on a limited subset of database files. Due to the differences between database versions and the complexity of the parsing we expect to find more parsing edge-cases.
        
        To help us resolve issues faster please provide as much data as you can when opening an issue - DB file if possible and full trace including log messages.
         
         
        ### Thanks
        * This library was made possible by the great work by mdb-tools. The logic in this library heavily relies on the excellent documentation they have https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools
        * Huge thanks to Mashav Sapir for the help debugging, CRing and contributing to this project https://github.com/mashavs
