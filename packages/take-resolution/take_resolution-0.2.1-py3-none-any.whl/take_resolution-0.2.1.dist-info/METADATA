## Initialing a kedro project

ResolutionAnalysis project is a kedro project.
It was initialized using `Kedro 0.15.9` by running:
```
kedro new
```

If you wish, see [kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to know more about.

## Configuring project

Here are shown recommended practices to configure project on local.

### Virtual environment

This step can be done with commands or on PyCharm.

#### On commands

It is recommended to use virtual environment:
```
pip install venv
```

Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```

Enter to virtual environment (Windows):
```
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

Enter to virtual environment (Linux):
```
./venv/bin/activate
```

To exit virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

#### On PyCharm

Open `File/Settings...` or press `Ctrl+Alt+S`.
This opens settings window.

Open `Project: ResolutionAnalysis/Project Interpreter` on left menu.

Open `Project Interpreter` combobox and click on `Show All...`.
This opens a window with Python interpreters.

Click on `+` or press `Alt+Insert`.
This opens a window to create a new Python interpreter.

We will choose default options that create a new virtual environment into project.
Click on `Ok` button.

Click on `Ok` button again.
And again.

### Configuring on PyCharm

If you are using PyCharm its better show PyCharm where is source code on project.
Right click on `src` folder in `Project` window at left side.
This opens context menu.

Choose `Mark Directory as/Sources Root` option.
This marks `src` as source root directory.
It will appears as blue folder on `Project` navigator.

## Installing dependencies

All dependencies are declared in `src/requirements.txt`.

Install dependencies can be done on command or on PyCharm.

### On command

To install them, run:
```
kedro install
```

Installing `take_resolution` with pip also installs dependencies:
```
pip install take_resolution
```

But if you are working on project, prefer do not install `take_resolution`.

### On PyCharm

After you created virtual environment or on open PyCharm, it will ask if you want to install requirements.
Choose `Install`.

## Writing notebooks

Start local notebook server:
```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

Or if you prefer, you can also use JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

Or if you want just an IPython session:
```
kedro ipython
```

On any of these cases, notebook or IPython session has the following variables in scope:
* `context`: Instance of `take_resolution.run.ProjectContext`. See it help.
* `startup_error`: Error on startup if any or None.

You can update changes on project to session using:
```
%reload_kedro
```

## Testing ResolutionAnalysis

You can test on commands or on PyCharm.

### On commands

First enter to virtual environment.
Then run kedro tests:
```
kedro test
```

See coverage results at `htmlcov/index.html`.

### On PyCharm

Click on `Edit Configurations...` beside `Run` icon.
This opens Run/Debug Configurations window.

Click on `+` or press `Alt+Insert`.

Choose `Python tests/pytest` option.

Fill `Target` field with path to tests folder as `<path to project>/src/tests`.

Click on `Ok` button.

Click on `Run` icon.
This run the tests.

Open `Terminal` window and run command to generate HTML report:
```
coverage html
```

See coverage results at `htmlcov/index.html`.

## Visualizing pipelines

First enter to virtual environment.
To visualize pipelines as graphs:
```
kedro viz
```

Or visualizing just a specific pipeline:
```
kedro viz --pipeline specific_pipeline
```

## Running ResolutionAnalysis

You can run on command or on PyCharm.

### On command

First enter to virtual environment.
Running all pipelines:
```
kedron run
```

Or running just a specific pipeline:
```
kedro run --pipeline specific_pipeline
```

### On PyCharm

Click on `Edit Configurations...` beside `Run` icon.
This opens Run/Debug Configurations window.

Click on `+` or press `Alt+Insert`.

Choose `Python` option.

Fill `Script path` field with run file as `<path to project>/src/take_resolution/run.py`.

Click on `Ok` button.

Click on `Run` icon.
This run all pipelines.

## Packaging ResolutionAnalysis

First enter to virtual environment.
To package ResolutionAnalysis into `.egg` and `.whell`:
```
kedro package
```

Generated packages will be in folder `src/dist`.

## Building documentation

To build API docs with Sphinx:
```
kedro build-docs
```

Generated documentation will be in `docs/build/html/index.html`.

## Uploading to PyPI

To upload build package to PyPI:
```
kedro upload
```

This upload the latest build version.
After, package can be downloaded and installed by pip in any place with python and pip:

```
pip install take_resolution
```

## Some tips

In order to maintain the project:
 * Do not remove or change any lines from the `.gitignore` unless you know what are you doing.
 * When developing experiments and production, follow [kedro data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/06_resources/01_faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention).
 * When developing experiments, put them into notebooks, following [code policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17EeKpq3svANefmZNwWM4uV2FKEnqxCyFYzkI04l4P38).
 * Organize notebooks into particular folder in folder `notebooks` and commit them.
 * Do not commit any data.
 * Do not commit any log file.
 * Do not commit any credentials or local configuration.
 * Keep all credentials or local configuration in folder `conf/local/`.
 * Do not commit any generated file on testing or building processes.
 * Run test before pull request to make sure that has no bug.
 * Follow git flow practices:
   * Create feature branch for new feature from `dev` branch.
   Work on this branch with commits and pushes.
   Send a pull request to `dev` branch when terminate the work.
   * When terminate a set of features to release, merge `dev` branch to `test` branch.
   Apply several and strict tests to be sure that all are fine.
   On find errors, fix all and apply tests again.
   When all are ok, merge from `test` to `master` increasing `setup` version and uploading to pipy.
   * If some bug is found on production, `master` branch, create hotfix branch from `master`.
   Correct all errors and apply tests like in `test` branch.
   When all are ok, merge from hotfix branch to `master` and then, merge from `master` to `dev`.
