USCrimes
This library gives quick and easy access to atrocities committed by the US Government and compiled by @dessalines (https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md).  
To use it, simply download the USCrimes module (containing `__init__.py` and `core.py`) and add it to your project.  
Currently the module allows you to fetch a random crime with `USCrimes.randomCrime()` or one containing a specific keyword with `USCrimes.searchCrime(keyword)`.
