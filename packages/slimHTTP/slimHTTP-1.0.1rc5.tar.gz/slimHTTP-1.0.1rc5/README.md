A simple, minimal and flexible Python HTTP server.<br>
Supports: REST, WebSocket¹, `vhost`'s, reverse proxy and static file delivery.

 * slimHTTP [documentation](https://slimhttp.readthedocs.io/en/master)
 * slimHTTP [discord](https://discord.gg/CMjZbwR) server

## Features

 * REST routes *(`@http.route('/some/endpoint')`)*
 * websockets using plugin [spiderWeb](https://github.com/Torxed/spiderWeb) ¹
 * Can emulate files via `@http.route('/example.html')`
 * vhosts
 * tls
 * reverse proxy
 * `.py` extensions in web-root/vhosts without having to use FastCGI
 * No threads used by default *(fully relies on `epoll()` (`select()` on Windows))*
 * flexible runtime configuration and re-configuration *(using `@http.configuration` annotation to achieve this)*

## Minimal example

```py
import slimHTTP

http = slimHTTP.host(slimHTTP.HTTP)
http.run()
```

Serves any files under `/srv/http` by default in `HTTP` mode.

## Footnote

It's not pretty down here. But it'll do in a pinch.
