Generate new projects from git repositories

new is a command to create new projects based on existing git repos. It simply shallow clones a repository to a directory with your specified new project name, and cleans up the git files like they were never there. It also supports 1:1 string replacement.

## Installation Options

https://pypi.org/project/new-project/

### PyPi

```sh
pip install new-project
```

## Usage

You can create new project from any github repository with just the username and project name

The following command will create a new project for you based on this one, if you do not provide a full
git url it will default to GitHub:
```sh
new myNewProject divanvisagie/new
```

You can also specify a URL to any git repository that you have access to:
```sh
new myNewProject git@gitlab.com:divan/new.git
```

These examples are just simple clones though, new also lets authors configure a 
repository so that it will prompt you to replace strings that you may want to rename
for your project.

You can give it a try with:

```sh
new myNewProject divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed
```

You will see that it prompts you to replace the package name, just pressing enter will skip this and keep the name:

```sh
> new myNewProject divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed
Creating testbed from https://github.com/divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed.git 
Enumerating objects: 14, done.
Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Total 14 (delta 0), reused 10 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

Enter replacement text for com.divanvisagie.example

    text       : com.divanvisagie.example
    description: The package name

> com.divanvisagie.mynewproject
```

The reason we see this is because the `kotlin-tested-seed` repository contains a `.new.yml` file at its root:

```yml
replace:
  strings:
    - match: com.divanvisagie.example
      description: The package name
```

You can configure as many match strings as you want in your own seed projects.
