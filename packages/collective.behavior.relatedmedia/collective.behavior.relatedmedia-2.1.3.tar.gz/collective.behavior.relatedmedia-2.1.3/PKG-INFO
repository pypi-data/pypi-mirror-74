        What can this package do for you?
        =================================
        
        This packages adds a dexterity behavior to manage content related images and attachments.
        
        
        Configure and activate
        ======================
        
        You have to define a Media Root Path where the uploaded Media is stored.
        The default media container is ``(site_root|nav_root)/media`` and can be changed in the Related Media Controlpanel.
        
        The behavior is automatically enabled for "Documents".
        Edit the data in the new tab "Related Media"
        
        
        Media Base Path Strategy
        ========================
        
        When a Document is created we generate a ``Related Media Base Path`` in the background to store all the uploaded Media.
        This base path is located in the configured Media Root Path above.
        
        The Edit form renders a structure pattern of the base path location where you can upload/rearrange/sort/rename/delete the
        related media inplace.

        Further settings (for gallery css classes handling the images) as well as additional Images and Files (located somewhere else as the base path) are below

        View
        ====
        
        Images are displayed in a viewlet below the content title with the selected
        css class.
        
        Attachments are displayed in a viewlet below the content body.

        This package does not include any CSS or JS resource to enable some nice
        gallery experience. You can define this in your themen package.
