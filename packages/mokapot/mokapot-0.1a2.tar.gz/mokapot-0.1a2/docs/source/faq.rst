What is a moka pot?
-----------------------

A moka pot is a stove top coffee maker, similar to a percolator. Moka pots are
often known as stove top espresso makers: water in the base is heated until the
pressure of the vapor forces liquid water through a packed disk of coffee
grounds. However, moka pots brew at a significantly lower pressure than true
espresso. This is unlike a percolator, where water is heated then condenses at
the top and drips through the grounds. Repeating of this process results in
stronger coffee the longer the percolator brews.

Why is mokapot named after a moka pot?
------------------------------------------

Percolator was named Percolator in part because the model training algorithm
resembles the process of brewing coffee with a percolator. We originally started
writing moka pot to re-score PSMs using static models that were already trained
by Percolator or other sources. In a way, we thought this was nice analogy
between how a moka pot compares with percolator for brewing coffee.

Then we decided to re-implement the full training procedure as well, making the
analogy break down. Now we're left with a little bit of a misnomer, but we think
that is OK.
