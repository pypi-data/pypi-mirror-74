Implementation of [pyfilesystem2](https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/) file system for Google Drive

# Usage

```python
  fs = GoogleDriveFS(credentials=<google-auth credentials>)

  # fs is now a standard pyfilesystem2 file system

  fs2 = open_fs("googledrive:///?access_token=<oauth2 access token>&refresh_token=<oauth2 refresh token>&client_id=<oauth2 client id>&client_secret=<oauth2 client secret>")

  # fs2 is now a standard pyfilesystem2 file system
```

# Running tests

To run the tests, set the following environment variables:

- GOOGLEDRIVEFS_TEST_CREDENTIALS_PATH - path to a json file which will contain the credentials
- GOOGLEDRIVEFS_TEST_CLIENT_ID - your client id (see Google Developer Console)
- GOOGLEDRIVEFS_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET - your client secret (see Google Developer Console)

Then generate the credentials json file by running

```bash
  python generate-credentials.py
```

Then run the tests by executing

```bash
  pytest
```

in the root directory. The tests may take an hour or two to complete. They create and destroy many, many files and directories mostly under the /test-googledrivefs directory in the user's Google Drive and a few in the root directory
