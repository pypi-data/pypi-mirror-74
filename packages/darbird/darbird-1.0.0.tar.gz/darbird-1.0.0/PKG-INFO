        ## Usage
        
        The package needs to be configured with your app username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://console.darbird.com/).
        
        > Your receipent number must be in an International Number example (+234xxxxxxxxxx)
        
        ```python
        # import package
        import darbird
        
        
        # Initialize SDK
        username = "YOUR_USERNAME"    # use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
        api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"      # use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
        darbird.initialize(username, api_key)
        
        
        # Initialize a service e.g. SMS
        sms = darbird.SMS
        
        
        # Use the service synchronously
        response = sms.send("Hello Message!", ["+2547xxxxxx"])
        print(response)
        
        # Or use it asynchronously
        def on_finish(error, response):
            if error is not None:
                raise error
            print(response)
        
        sms.send("Hello Message!", ["+2547xxxxxx"], callback=on_finish)    
        
        ```
        
        See [example](example/) for more usage examples.
