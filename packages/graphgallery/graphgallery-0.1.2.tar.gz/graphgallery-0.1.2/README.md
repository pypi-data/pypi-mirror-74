# GraphGallery

A gallery of state-of-the-arts graph neural networks.. 

Implemented with Tensorflow 2.x.

This repo aims to achieve 4 goals:
+ Similar (or higher) performance with the corresponding papers
+ Faster implementation of training and testing
+ Simple and convenient to use, high scalability
+ Easy to read source codes
