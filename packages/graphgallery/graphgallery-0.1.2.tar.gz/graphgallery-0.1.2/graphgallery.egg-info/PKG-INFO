Description: # GraphGallery
        
        A gallery of state-of-the-arts graph neural networks.. 
        
        Implemented with Tensorflow 2.x.
        
        This repo aims to achieve 4 goals:
        + Similar (or higher) performance with the corresponding papers
        + Faster implementation of training and testing
        + Simple and convenient to use, high scalability
        + Easy to read source codes
