    Provides a structure for defining oscillators which will be tracked by

    and implementing the _generate(phase) method. The phase parameter will be
    automatically calculated from the inputs to forward(). It is also important

        """Generate a signal given a set of parameters.

        Uses the frequency, phase_mod, length, and sample_rate parameters to
        determine the best output shape, and then generate a signal by calling
        the subclass generate() method. Parameters frequency and phase_mod can
        either be scalar values, or can have time axes and batch dimensions.
        Any extra keyword arguments are passed directly to _generate.

        Args:
            frequency (torch.Tensor): The sample-wise instantaneous frequency
                of the oscillator. Can be of shapes ([S], [N, S], [T], [N, T],
                [..., N, S], [..., N, T]) where S is a scalar value, T is a
                time dimension, N is a batch dimension, and ... signifies any
                number of extra dimensions.
            phase_mod (torch.Tensor, optional): The sample-wise phase
                modulation used in oscillation (useful for pitch modulation
                and FM synthesis). Can be of same shapes as frequency. Shape
                must be broadcastable with frequency. Defaults to None.
            length (int, optional): Length of output's time dimension in
                samples. This is required if a scalar value is passed in for
                both frequency and phase_mod. Otherwise it is inferred from the
                length of the last axis. Defaults to None.
            sample_rate (float, optional): The sample rate in Hz. If not
                specified, instantaneous frequency is interpreted as angular
                frequency in radians per sample. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: The oscillator's output signal.
