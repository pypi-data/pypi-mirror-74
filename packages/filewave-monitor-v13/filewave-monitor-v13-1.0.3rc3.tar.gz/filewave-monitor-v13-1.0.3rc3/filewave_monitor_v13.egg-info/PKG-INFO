Description: # monitor-fw-13
        An additional module that installs programs/config required to monitor v13 instances via Prometheus. 
        
        # Installation
        Use pip to install this module first, then run a configuration stage to integrate this module properly into the v13 server. 
        
        Instructions:
        
            $ sudo su -
            $ /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/pip3 install --upgrade filewave-monitor-v13
            $ /usr/local/filewave/python/bin/monitor-v13-install
        
        # Restart Services
        Restart supervisord (not just fwcontrol; more programs were added so don't skip this step)
        
            $ /usr/local/filewave/python.v27/bin/supervisorctl -c /usr/local/etc/filewave/supervisor/supervisord-server.conf reload
        
        # Validation (did it all work?): 
        Check the following: 
        
            $ ls -l /tmp/mtail.INFO - this should produce some output and tell you that the mtail progs loaded OK
            $
