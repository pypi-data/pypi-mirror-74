Intuitive static Python client for Driverless AI

Goals

- Provide a stable API that will be backwards compatible with any code written for it, starting from Driverless AI 1.8.0 (in other words, when the client is updated, don't break any code that has already been written with the API)

- Be simple and intuitive to use

- Comprehensive documentation

Beta Note

Thank you for trying the Driverless AI Python Client beta! Since this is a beta, please keep in mind

- The API is subject to change

- There are missing features

- It probably has bugs

Please send feedback to help improve the client and [documentation](http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/pyclient/docs/html/index.html) to support@h2o.ai.
