Description: # Bot Bin
        Shared cogs and utilities for use in Discord bots.
        Some cogs require bot configuration; those that do expect a `bot.config` dict attribute.
        
        ## bot_bin.bot
        
        Contains an AutoShardedBot subclass. Contains custom error logging, customizable on_message bot ignoring,
        case insensitive prefixes, and database setup if the setup_db kwarg is set to True. Requires the config kwarg
        to be set to a dict. bot.config['tokens']['discord'] should be the bot's Discord token.
        
        ## bot_bin.debug
        
        Contains memory usage and performance debugging commands. Most other debug functionality is already provided
        by [jishaku](https://pypi.org/project/jishaku/).
        
        ## bot_bin.misc
        
        Contains an uptime, ping, and copyright command. The latter requires bot.config['copyright_license_file'] to be
        set to a path to a text file, the contents of which will be sent when the user runs the copyright command.
        
        Also contains various utilities:
        - `codeblock` wraps text in a markdown code block
        - `absolute_natural_timedelta` returns an English string representing an amount of seconds
        - `natural_timedelta` returns an English string representing the difference between two dates.
          This function differs from `absolute_natural_timedelta` in that it also supports years and months.
        - `natural_rate` returns an English string representing a rate of occurence.
        - `plural` is a format object which pluralizes strings. For example: `f'Found {plural(len(results)):weapon}'`
        - `natural_join` joins a sequence of strings according to English grammar
        - `timeit` is a context manager that times the code in the `with` block
        
        ## bot_bin.sql
        
        Contains SQL execution commands for asyncpg.
        Requires `bot.pool` to be set to either an asyncpg Connection or a ConnectionPool.
        Requires the `bot_bin[sql]` extra.
        
        ## bot_bin.stats
        
        Implements the guild count API for DBL, DBots, Bots For Discord, LBots, and Discord Boats.
        This is configured using `bot.config['tokens']['stats']`.
        Each key should be a domain, e.g. `bot.config['tokens']['stats']['discordbots.org']` would be the bot's DBL token.
        
        Defines a `send-stats` owner only command which sends the current guild counts to the configured APIs
        and reports any errors.
