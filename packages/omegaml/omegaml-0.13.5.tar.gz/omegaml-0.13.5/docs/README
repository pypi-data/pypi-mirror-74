This sphinx project is setup to work as follows:

1. change to the virtualenv for omegaml 
2. cd docs
3. make livehtml

livehtml will monitor the source folder and automatically
rebuild the html pages whenever a new file is added or an
existing file changes.

So to edit and browse the results:

4. edit files in source/*.rst
5. open localhost:8000
