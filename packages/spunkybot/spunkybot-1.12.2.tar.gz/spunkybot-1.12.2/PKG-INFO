Description: Overview
        ========
        `Spunky Bot`_ is a lightweight game server administration bot and RCON tool.
        Its purpose is to administer, manage and maintain an `Urban Terror`_ server and
        to provide real time statistics data for players.
        
        Spunky Bot is a cross-platform package and offers in-game commands without
        authentication and automated administration even when no admin is online.
        
        Your gameserver can be enhanced with the ultimate administration power that
        Spunky Bot brings! The all-in-one server administration bot for Urban Terror
        gives admins the power to easily manage and administrate their server.
        It allows players access to statistics and gives powerful options to manage
        the flow of a game.
        
        Spunky Bot is free and open source, released under the MIT_ license.

        The installation is just click and go. There is no need to install a heavy
