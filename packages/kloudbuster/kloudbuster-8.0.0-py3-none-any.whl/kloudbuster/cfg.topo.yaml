# Compute host topology file template for running KloudBuster
# Usage: Pass to KloudBuster using -t <path>
#
# A typical use of this topology file is to shape traffic in order
# to maximize inter-rack L3 traffic.
#
# With 2 racks, simply place each rack node name in each group.
# With more than 2 racks, separate the racks in 2 groups.
#
# Note
# ====
#
# 1. When used, the topology file will override any availability zone
# settings in the confguration file.
#
# 2. The compute host name must be exactly the same as shown from NOVA:
# i.e. "nova hypervisor-list"

# Grouping for placing all the server side VMs
# Do not change the group name, you can add as many hosts as needed
servers_rack:
    - hh23-5
    - hh23-6

# Grouping for placing all the client side VMs
# Do not change the group name, you can add as many hosts as needed
clients_rack:
    - hh23-7
    - hh23-8
