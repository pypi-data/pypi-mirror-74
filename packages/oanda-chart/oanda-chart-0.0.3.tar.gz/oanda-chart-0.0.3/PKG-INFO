# oanda-chart
Oanda forex candle chart tkinter widget.

#### Warning:
This package does not yet have all its core features, and even its
current features might change significantly.

It was uploaded to pypi.org early as an experiment to see if the package
could find some "png" after installation...not because it was at
all ready.

#### Some Background
This is being built on top of oanda-candles package which is built
on top of the oandaV20 package, which uses the Oanda Restful API.

It provides a tkinter chart widget and associated widgets to select
the instrument pair, granularity, and ask/mid/bid.
