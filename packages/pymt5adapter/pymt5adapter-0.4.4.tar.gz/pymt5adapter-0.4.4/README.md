# Introduction

`pymt5adapter` is a drop-in replacement (wrapper) for the `MetaTrader5` python package by MetaQuotes. 
The API functions simply pass through values from the `MetaTrader5` functions, but adds the following functionality
in addition to a more pythonic interface:

 - Typing hinting has been added to all functions and return objects for linting and IDE integration. 
 Now intellisense will work no matter how nested objects are. ![alt text][intellisence_screen]
 - Docstrings have been added to each function 
 (see official MQL [documentation](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/integration/python_metatrader5)). 
 Docs can now be accessed on the fly in the IDE. For example: `Ctrl+Q` in pycharm. ![alt text][docs_screen]
 - All params can now be called by keyword. No more positional only args.
 - Testing included compliments of `pytest`
 - A new context manager has been added to provide a more pythonic interface to the setup and tear-down 
 of the terminal connection. The use of this context-manager can do the following: 
 
   - Ensures that `mt5.shutdown()` is always called, even if the user code throws an uncaught exception.
   - Modifies the global behavior of the API:
      - Ensure the terminal has enabled auto-trading.
      - Prevents running on real account by default
      - Accepts a logger and automatically logs function API calls and order activity. 
      - Can raise the custom `MT5Error `exception whenever `last_error()[0] != RES_S_OK` (off by default)


# Installation

```
pip install -U pymt5adapter
```
 
The `MetaTrader5` dependency sometimes has issues installing with the `pip` version that automatically gets 
packaged inside of the `virualenv` environment. If cannot install `MetaTrader5` then you need to update `pip` 
inside of the virtualenv. From the command line within the virual environment use:

```
(inside virtualenv):easy_install -U pip
```

# Import  
This should work with any existing `MetaTrader5` script by simply changing the `import` statement from:  
```python
import MetaTrader5 as mt5 
```
to:  
```python
import pymt5adapter as mt5 
``` 
     
# Context Manager

The `connected` function returns a context manager which performs all API setup and tear-down and ensures 
that `mt5.shutdown()` is always called. 

### Hello world

Using the context manager can be easy as...

```python
import pymt5adapter as mt5

with mt5.connected():
    print(mt5.version())

```

and can be customized to modify the entire API

```python
import pymt5adapter as mt5
import logging

logger = mt5.get_logger(path_to_logfile='my_mt5_log.log', loglevel=logging.DEBUG, time_utc=True)

mt5_connected = mt5.connected(
    path=r'C:\Users\user\Desktop\MT5\terminal64.exe',
    portable=True,
    server='MetaQuotes-Demo',
    login=1234567,
    password='password1',
    timeout=5000,
    logger=logger, # default is None
    ensure_trade_enabled=True,  # default is False
    enable_real_trading=False,  # default is False
    raise_on_errors=True,  # default is False
    return_as_dict=False, # default is False
    return_as_native_python_objects=False, # default is False
)
with mt5_connected as conn:
    try:
        num_orders = mt5.history_orders_total("invalid", "arguments")
    except mt5.MT5Error as e:
        print("We modified the API to throw exceptions for all functions.")
        print(f"Error = {e}")
    # change error handling behavior at runtime
    conn.raise_on_errors = False
    try:
        num_orders = mt5.history_orders_total("invalid", "arguments")
    except mt5.MT5Error:
        pass
    else:
        print('We modified the API to silence Exceptions at runtime')
```

Output:

```
MT5 connection has been initialized.
[history_orders_total(invalid, arguments)][(-2, 'Invalid arguments')][None]
We modified the API to throw exceptions for all functions.
Error = (<ERROR_CODE.INVALID_PARAMS: -2>, "Invalid arguments('invalid', 'arguments'){}")
[history_orders_total(invalid, arguments)][(-2, 'Invalid arguments')][None]
We modified the API to silence Exceptions at runtime
[shutdown()][(1, 'Success')][True]
MT5 connection has been shutdown.

```

# Exception handling

The `MetaTrader5` package does not raise exceptions and all errors fail silently
by default. This behavior forces the developer to check each object for 
`None` or `empty` state and then call `last_error()` to resolve any possible errors.
One of the primary features of the context manager is extend the ability
to toggle exceptions on/off globally. All raised exceptions are of type `MT5Error`. The
`MT5Error` exception has two properties which are `error_code` and `description`. 

```python
with mt5.connected(raise_on_errors=True) as conn:
    try:
        invalid_args = mt5.history_deals_get('sdf', 'asdfa')
        print(invalid_args)
    except mt5.MT5Error as e:
        print(e.error_code, e.description)
        if e.error_code is mt5.ERROR_CODE.INVALID_PARAMS:
            print('You can use "is" to check identity since we use enums')
    conn.raise_on_errors = False
    print('Errors will not raise exceptions and default behavior has bene restored at runtime')
    invalid_args = mt5.history_deals_get('sdf', 'asdfa')
    if not invalid_args:
        print(mt5.last_error())
```
OUTPUT
```
ERROR_CODE.INVALID_PARAMS Invalid arguments('sdf', 'asdfa'){}
You can use "is" to check identity since we use enums
Errors will not raise exceptions and default behavior has bene restored at runtime
(-2, 'Invalid arguments')
```

# Logging

Logging functionality has been added to the API and can be utilized by passing any logger that implements the
`logging.Logger` interface to the `logger` param in `connected` context manager. Messages generated from the API
functions are always tab deliminated and include two parts:
1. A short human readable message.
2. A JSON dump for easy log parsing and debugging. 
```
2020-07-22 18:54:10,399	INFO	Terminal Initialize Success	{"type": "terminal_connection_state", "state": true}
```
For convenience, a preconfigured logger can be retrieved by calling `get_logger`
```python
logger = mt5.get_logger(path_to_logfile='my_mt5_log.log', loglevel=logging.DEBUG, time_utc=True)

with mt5.connected(logger=logger):
    main()
```
Note: The API will only automatically log if a logger is passed into the context manager. The intent was to provide
convenience but not force an opinionated logging schema.

# Additional features not included in the `MetaTrader5` package

### Filter function callbacks

The following API functions can now except an optional callback for filtering using the named parameter, `function`:
* `symbols_get`
* `orders_get`
* `positions_get`
* `history_deals_get`
* `history_orders_get`

Example:

```python
visible_symbols = mt5.symbols_get(function=lambda s: s.visible)

def out_deal(deal: mt5.TradeDeal):
    return deal.entry == mt5.DEAL_ENTRY_OUT

out_deals = mt5.history_deals_get(function=out_deal)
```
