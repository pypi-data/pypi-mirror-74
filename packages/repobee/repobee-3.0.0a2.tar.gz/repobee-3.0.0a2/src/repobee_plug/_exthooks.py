"""Hookspecs for repobee extension hooks.

Extension hooks add something to the functionality of repobee, but are not
necessary for its operation. Currently, all extension hooks are related to
cloning repos.

        of this hook that adds a subcommand called ``example-command``, that
        can be called with ``repobee example-command``.

            The ``-tb|--traceback`` argument is always added to the parser.
            Make sure not to add any conflicting arguments.

        .. important::

            If you need to use the api, you set ``requires_api=True`` in the
            ``ExtensionCommand``. This will automatically add the options that
            the API requires to the CLI options of the subcommand, and
            initialize the api and pass it in.
