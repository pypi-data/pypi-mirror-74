Description: # RobotNotifications
        
        
        Send notifications to Slack or Mattermost using Robot Framework.
        Can be used both as library or listener.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The recommended installation method is pip:
        
            pip install robotframework-notifications
        
        Running this command installs also the latest version of Requests
        
        
        ## Use as listener
        
        ```robot --listener "RobotNotifications;https://webhook_url;end_test;summary" test.robot```
        
        Listeners are taken into use from the command line with the --listener option.
        
        - The first argument is the name of the library.
        - The second argument is the webhook url.
        - Based on your preferences pick the next argument(s) from the table 
        
        Seperate the arguments with a semicolon ;
        
        ## Optional Arguments

        ## Use as library
        
        Besides the listener functionality this library allows you to post a custom message with the use of the keyword "Post Message To Channel"
        
        To use RobotNotifications in Robot Framework, the library needs to be imported using the ``Library`` setting as any other library. The library needs the webhook url from Slack or Mattermost as an argument.
        
        Example:
        ```robotframework
        *** Settings ***
        Library         RobotNotifications   https://hooks.slack.com/services/--your-webhook--
        ```
        You can retrieve this webhook url in Slack or Mattermost.
        
        Example 2:
        ```robotframework
        *** Settings ***
        Library         RobotNotifications   https://hooks.slack.com/services/--your-webhook--
        ...             end_suite   end_test
        ```
        
        ## Write a custom message
        
        After importing the library you have access to the keyword ``Post Message To Channel``
        
        This keyword has one mandatory argument which is the message to post to the channel, and several optional arguments.
        
        | Argument   | Description                                                  | Required |
        | ---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
        | text       | Markdown-formatted message to display in the post.           | YES      |
        | channel    | Overrides the channel the message posts in. Use the channel’s name and not the display name. Defaults to the channel set during webhook creation. | NO       |
        | username   | Overrides the username the message posts as. Defaults to the username set during webhook creation or the webhook creator’s username if the former was not set. | NO       |
        | icon_url   | Overrides the profile picture the message posts with. Defaults to the URL set during webhook creation or the webhook creator’s profile picture if the former was not set. | NO       |
        | icon_emoji | Overrides the profile picture and `icon_url` parameter. Defaults to none and is not set during webhook creation. | NO       |
        | props      | Sets the post `props`, a JSON property bag for storing extra or meta data on the post. | NO       |
        
        Example:
        ```robotframework
        *** Settings ***
        Library         RobotNotifications   https://hooks.slack.com/services/--your-webhook--
              
        *** Test Cases ***
        Example Test
            Post Message To Channel      This is a custom message!    icon_emoji=robot_face    username=Robot    
            ...                          channel=robot-notifications
        ```    
        The above example shows how the ``Post Message To Channel`` can be used in Robot Framework.
