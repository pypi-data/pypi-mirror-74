Overview
========

web-poet is a library which defines a standard on how to write and organize
web data extraction code.

If web scraping code is written as web-poet Page Objects, it can be reused
in different contexts. For example, such code can be developed in an
`IPython notebook`_, then tested in isolation, and then plugged
into a Scrapy_ spider, or used as a part of some custom aiohttp_-based
web scraping framework.

Currently, the following integrations are available:

* Scrapy, via scrapy-poet_
