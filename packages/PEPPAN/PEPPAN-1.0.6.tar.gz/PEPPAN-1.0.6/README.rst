About PEPPAN
PEPPAN (Phylogeny Enhanced Pipeline for PAN-genome) is a pipeline that can construct a pan-genome from thousands of genetically diversified bacterial genomes. PEPPAN implements a combination of tree- and synteny-based approaches to identify and exclude paralogous genes, as well as similarity-based gene predictions that support consistent annotations of genes and pseudogenes in individual genomes.
