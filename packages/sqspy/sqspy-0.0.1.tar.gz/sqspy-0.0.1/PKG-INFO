Description: # sqspy
        
        A more pythonic approach to SQS producer/consumer utilities. Heavily
        inspired from the [the pySqsListener][1] package.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```Shell
        pip install sqspy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```Python
        from sqspy import Consumer
        
        
        class MyWorker(Consumer):
            def handle_message(self, body, attributes, message_attributes):
                print(body)
        
        
        listener = MyWorker('Q1', error_queue='EQ1')
        listener.listen()
        ```
        
        More documentation coming soon.
        
        ## Why
        
        The mentioned project had a few issues which I faced while trying to
        implement at my organisation. The local environment testing setup was
        very flaky. The signatures for `sqs_listener` and `sqs_producer` were
        very different from each other.
        
        This rewrite supports python 3.6+ versions only, and makes use of a
        lot of pythonic features. It also makes use of service resources (for
        lazy calls) from the boto3 library instead of making calls via the low
        level client.
