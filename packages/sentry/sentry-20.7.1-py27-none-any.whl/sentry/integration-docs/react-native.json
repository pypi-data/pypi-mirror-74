  "html": "<h2 id=\"integrating-the-sdk\">Integrating the SDK</h2>\n\n<p>Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application\u2019s runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.</p>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n<h5 class=\"no_toc\">Note</h5>\n<div class=\"alert-body content-flush-bottom\">\n<p>If you are using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">expo-cli</code> you need to use another SDK see: <a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-sentry/\">https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-sentry/</a> This SDK only works for ejected projects or projects that directly use React Native.</p> </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>To install the React Native SDK, add the dependency to your project by either using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">npm</code> or <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">yarn</code>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>npm <span class=\"nb\">install</span> @sentry/react-native <span class=\"nt\">--save</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># or</span>\nyarn add @sentry/react-native\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"linking\">Linking</h3>\n\n<p>Since our SDK also supports native crashes, we need to link the SDK to your native projects.</p>\n\n<p>Above <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">react-native &gt;= 0.60</code> you need to do:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>npx sentry-wizard <span class=\"nt\">-i</span> reactNative <span class=\"nt\">-p</span> ios android\n<span class=\"c\"># or</span>\nyarn sentry-wizard <span class=\"nt\">-i</span> reactNative <span class=\"nt\">-p</span> ios android\n\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>ios\npod <span class=\"nb\">install</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since our SDK supports <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md\">auto-linking</a> and iOS relies on CocoaPods, you need to install the dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>If you are running a project with <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">react-native &lt; 0.60</code> you still need to call <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">react-native link</code>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>react-native <span class=\"nb\">link</span> @sentry/react-native\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <em>link</em> step or the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">sentry-wizard</code> call will patch your project accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard\">Sentry Wizard</a> will guide you through the process of setting everything up correctly. This has to be done only once, and the files created can go into your version control system.</p>\n\n<p>The following changes will be performed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>add the sentry-android package for native crash reporting on Android</li>\n  <li>add the sentry-cocoa package for native crash reporting on iOS</li>\n  <li>enable the Sentry Gradle build step for Android</li>\n  <li>patch <em>_MainApplication.java_</em> for Android</li>\n  <li>configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your <em>_index.js/App.js_</em> files</li>\n  <li>store build credentials in <em>_ios/sentry.properties_</em> and <em>_android/sentry.properties_</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"connecting-the-sdk-to-sentry\">Connecting the SDK to Sentry</h2>\n\n<p>After you\u2019ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it\u2019s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.</p>\n\n<p>To initialize the SDK, you need to call:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nx\">Sentry</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@sentry/react-native'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    \n<span class=\"nx\">Sentry</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">init</span><span class=\"p\">({</span> \n  <span class=\"na\">dsn</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s1\">'___PUBLIC_DSN___'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> \n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">sentry-wizard</code> will try to add it to your <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">App.js</code></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"verifying-your-setup\">Verifying Your Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Great! Now that you\u2019ve completed setting up the SDK, maybe you want to quickly test out how Sentry works. You can trigger a JS exception by throwing one in your application:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">throw</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nb\">Error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"My first Sentry error!\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can even try a native crash with:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nx\">Sentry</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">nativeCrash</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n</code></pre>",
