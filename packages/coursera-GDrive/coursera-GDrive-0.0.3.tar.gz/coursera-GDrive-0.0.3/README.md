### If you want to use this package by writing your own code;

First of all, you have to know the basics of Python to understand the given instructions below.

### Initializing

- #### Initialize the downloader object with default save folder (COURSERA).
	```

  ```
  downloader = CourseraDownloader(<folder-name>)

  # Example:
  # downloader = CourseraDownloader("coursera_files")
  ```

### Authentication and Authorization

Before we go further, we must authenticate ourselves first. For that purpose, we need to CAUTH token which is using for one of the main authentication method by Coursera.

- #### How to find your Coursera CAUTH token by using your browser?

	cauth = <cauth-token>

	# Example:
	# cauth = "t-w_itR2tML6ZWA_myKtQeC0JO97SJFkh3PgatWw32t4nrlZrHKsfe2sw"
	```
- #### How to login with your CAUTH Token?

	```
	downloader.login(cauth)
	```
### Courses Lists
Last one step before download, if you want to see some useful courses list, you have to read this section.

	downloader.printEnrolledCourses() 
	# Prints all enrolled Courses.
	```
- #### How to see all available courses in Coursera?

	```
	downloader.printAllCourses() 
	# Prints all courses in Coursera.
	```

### Downloading the Courses

- ### How to download all of my enrolled course?
	It's very straight forward. Just call the download method.
	```
	downloader.download()
	# Downloads all enrolled courses.
	```
- ### How to download just one course?
	Make sure that the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name used in the URL for that class:
	 `https://www.coursera.org/learn/<course-name>/home/welcome`
	 
	**Example:**
	`https://www.coursera.org/learn/`**algorithmic-toolbox**`/home/welcome`

	```
	downloader.download("<course-name>") 
	# Downloads just <course-name>.

	# Example:
	# downloader.download("algorithmic-toolbox")
	```
- ### How to download one or more course?
	There are several methods to download multiple courses easily.
	- #### Multiple Course String Argument
	```
	downloader.download("<course1>","<course2>","<course3>",...) 
	# Downloads all the given courses.

	# Example:
	# downloader.download("algorithmic-toolbox","crypto","iot","python-ar")
	```
	- #### Python List Argument
	```
	course_list = ["<course1>","<course2>","<course3>",...]
	downloader.download(course_list) 
	# Downloads all courses in python list.

	# Example:
	# course_list = ["algorithmic-toolbox","crypto","iot","python-ar"]
	# downloader.download(course_list)
	```
	- #### Passing a text file as an argument
	Make sure that,
	1. Course names in text file are separated by a newline.
	2. Text file is in the save folder. ( Default: COURSERA )

	downloader.download("<courselist.txt>") 
	# Downloads all courses in text file.
