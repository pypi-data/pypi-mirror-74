Description: # PwnMachine
        
        PwnMachine is a self hosting solution based on docker aiming to provide an easy to use pwning station for bughunters.
        
        The basic install include a DNS server, a reverse proxy and a webserver.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        #### On your home computer
        
        * docker-machine
        * sshfs (optional)
        * python3
        * docker-compose
        
        You need to create a docker-machine for your server.
         
        ```shell
        docker-machine create \ 
         --driver generic \
         --generic-ip-address=0.0.0.0 \
         --generic-ssh-user=root \
         --generic-ssh-key=/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa \
         your_machine_name
        ```
        
        For more information: https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/generic/
        
        
        #### On your server
        
        required available port:
        * tcp: `80` `443` `53`
        * udp: `53`
        
        On a fresh Ubuntu server installation systemd listen on port 53 you will need to shut the service down and change your dns.
        
        ```bash
        systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved.service
        echo "nameserver 208.67.222.222" > /etc/resolv.conf #opendns servers
        ```
        
        #### DNS
        
        You must set your host as your authoritative nameserver.
        You must wait for the DNS propagation or the domain verification by let's encrypt will fail.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        First install the pm client.
        ```shell
        pip install pwn-machine
        ```
        
        or for a cutting edge build:
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/yeswehack/pwn-machine/
        cd pwn-machine
        pip install .
        ```
        
        
        On your first run you need to setup PwnMachine with
        
        ```shell
        pm setup
        ```
        
        This will start an interactive installer. The installer will create the configuration directory and add the required environment variable and autocompletion to your shell init file.
        
        Then you can build and start all your services.
        ```shell
        pm service build
        pm service start
        ```
        You can check that everything is running with
        
        ```shell
        pm ps
        ```
