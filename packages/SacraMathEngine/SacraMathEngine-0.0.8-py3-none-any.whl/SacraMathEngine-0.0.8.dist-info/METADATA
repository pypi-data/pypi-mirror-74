# SacraMathEngine
 SacraMathEngine is built as the default MathEngine for Sacra Game Engine. It has the basic features such as vector definitions, scalar multiplication of such an object, as well as matrix definitions.

# Installation
Using PIP you'll be able to install SacraMathEngine, however note that this package is built for the sole reason of being inside Sacra Game Engine. If might not fit your needs nor your hopes.
```bash
pip install SacraMathEngine
```

# Usage
As stated before, this package is built as a helper-package, for simplicity, for Sacra Game Engine, and thus the author ("Andreas Evensen"), do not recommend using this outside of the grasp of it's intended use. It's fully functional, with the most basic of operations.

```python
vector1 = vec3d(1,1,1)
vector2 = vec3d(1,1,1)
print(vector1 + vector2)
```
A small demonstration of code.
