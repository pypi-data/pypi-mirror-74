        ======
        
        The package contains the utilities which are used by
        `Pieman <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman>`__, script for creating
        custom OS images for single-board computers. The utilities are:
        
        -  ``apk_tools_version.py``: fetches the latest version of the
           apk-tools-static package.
        -  ``bsc.py``: BSC (Build Status Codes)
           `client <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman/blob/master/doc/bsc_server_and_client.md>`__.
        -  ``bscd.py``: BSC (Build Status Codes)
           `server <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman/blob/master/doc/bsc_server_and_client.md>`__.
        -  ``check_mutually_exclusive_params.py``: checks if two specified
           environment variables are defined.
        -  ``check_redis.py``: checks if the Redis server, needed by `BSC server
           and
           client <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman/blob/master/doc/bsc_server_and_client.md>`__,
           is available.
        -  ``check_wpa_passphrase.py``: checks if WPA passphrases are valid. A
           passphrase is considered as valid when 1) it's between 8 and 63
           characters and 2) it doesn't contain any special characters. These
           two simple checks were borrowed from the original wpa\_supplicant
           codebase and rewritten in Python (see
           ``wpa_supplicant/wpa_passphrase.c``).
        -  ``depend_on.py``: sometimes one environment variable (A) can't be
           specified without another one (B), so this utility helps Pieman
           explicitly say that A depends on B and check if B is set to true (if
           bool) or simply specified (in other cases) when A is set to true (if
           bool) or simply specified (in other cases).
        -  ``du.py``: provides the disk usage of the specified directory. It was
           developed primarily for estimating chroot environments disk usage. In
           some cases the utility provides more accurate result than ``du`` from
           GNU `coreutils <https://gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`__.
        -  ``image_attrs.py``: allows getting image attributes which are stored
           in the ``pieman.yml`` files. The utility is more high-level tool than
           `PyYAML <https://pyyaml.org>`__ because it's aware of the
           ``pieman.yml`` specifics.
        -  ``render.py``: renders config templates (which are
           `Jinja2 <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`__ templates under the
           hood).
        -  ``wget.py``: very limited GNU
           `Wget <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>`__ alternative.
