## Documentation
[**View the documentation here**](https://kevinmusgrave.github.io/powerful-benchmarker/)

## A Metric Learning Reality Check
This library was used for [A Metric Learning Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08505). See [the documentation](https://kevinmusgrave.github.io/powerful-benchmarker/papers/mlrc) for supplementary material.

## Benchmark results: 
- [4-fold cross validation, test on 2nd-half of classes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brUBishNxmld-KLDAJewIc43A4EVZk3gY6yKe8OIKbY/edit?usp=sharing)

## Benefits of this library
1. Highly configurable
    - Use the default configs files, merge in your own, or override options via the command line.
2. Extensive logging
    - View experiment data in tensorboard, csv, and sqlite format.
3. Easy hyperparameter optimization
    - Simply append \~BAYESIAN\~ to the hyperparameters you want to optimize.
4. Customizable
    - Benchmark your own losses, miners, datasets etc. with a simple function call.

## Installation
```
pip install powerful-benchmarker
```
