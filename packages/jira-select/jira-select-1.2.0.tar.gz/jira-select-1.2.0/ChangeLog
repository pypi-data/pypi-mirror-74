1.0.0
-----

* Minor tagline change
* Break up documentation for various commands into two different categories
* Add package installation to the quickstart

* Updating demo gif images; use 'id' for field names instead of 'key'
* Add support for connecting to multiple instances
* Better section titles
* Adding docs requirements file
* Updating description for field\_by\_name
* Adding much-better docs
* Switch to vi bindings by default. Display configuration path in --help
* Fixing a bug in how 'having' counts are piped through
* Re-labeling the 'query' progressbar 'jira'
* Updating readme
* Adding documentation covering the new 'shell' subcommand
* Adding new 'shell' subcommand allowing you to interactively run/view query results
* Updating title of 'functions.rst' to make it clearer what functions we're talking about
* Linking to the dateutil docs for parse\_datetime
* Adding 'parse\_datetime' function to default functions
* Adding new 'sprint\_details' function; fixed a bug around how null values were handled in a search query
* Fixing more bugs in group\_by; I think things are pretty sane now.  Adding separate progressbar for 'select'
* Fixing bugs in sorting via sort\_by
* Limit JQL max results to the specified query limit
* Surface jql ordering in 'order\_by'; move existing python sorting to 'sort\_by'
* Refactoring handling of group by; improving progressbar handling
* Adding debugger support
* Install visidata by default to ensure that the 'vd' command is available
* Adding documentation
* Fixing a test
* Adding some more tests
* Updating readme slightly
* Adding JSON load/dump functions to default-available functions
* Adding raw field data to search results in schema to allow for complex filtering by users
* Adding 'search-terms' functionality in addition to the existing 'having' checks
* Nevermind; supporting 3.6 would be more effort than I'm willing to spend today
* Try running tests for 3.6, too
* Better compatibility with Python 3.7
* Import literal from typing\_extensions instead of typing
* Updating test runner script
* Updating gitignore
* Adding tests
* Removing an unused import
* Adding support for github acitons
* Use getpass for 'store-password' instead of the interactive dialog
* Adding a command that will display information about available functions
* Updating store-password to use prompt-toolkit
* Removing one-offed functions that can be handled with standard python syntax
* Adding 'field\_by\_name' function allowing you to not memorize Jira field ids
* Allow grouping on expressions, too
* Break progressbar out into multiple phases; add support for ordering
* Add lots of functions to the default set
* Adding documentation covering grouping/aggregation
* Moving progressbar logic into the query class itself; it's really the only place we actually know how about all of the issues because we might not emit records if those records are grouped or filtered via having
* Adding support for 'group\_by' statements & (theoretically) aggregation functions
* Bumping version number
* Adding a comment to explain why there's a progressbar wrapping nothing
* Show a progressbar when counting rows, too
* Adding note to readme about the future w/r/t aggregation functions
* Updating help text slightly
* Changing name of 'find-field' to 'schema' and adding support for arbitrary 'having' expressions
* Adding support for limits; adding documentation covering limit and expand
* Return all fields from original search query using "\*all" "field" expansion; the jira-python docs suggest that this is the default, but the default is in fact "\*navigable"
* Adding more commentary to the readme
