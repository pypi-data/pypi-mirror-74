* Adding 'field\_by\_name' function allowing you to not memorize Jira field ids
* Allow grouping on expressions, too
* Break progressbar out into multiple phases; add support for ordering
* Add lots of functions to the default set
* Adding documentation covering grouping/aggregation
* Moving progressbar logic into the query class itself; it's really the only place we actually know how about all of the issues because we might not emit records if those records are grouped or filtered via having
* Adding support for 'group\_by' statements & (theoretically) aggregation functions
* Bumping version number
* Adding a comment to explain why there's a progressbar wrapping nothing
* Show a progressbar when counting rows, too
* Adding note to readme about the future w/r/t aggregation functions
* Updating help text slightly
* Changing name of 'find-field' to 'schema' and adding support for arbitrary 'having' expressions
* Adding support for limits; adding documentation covering limit and expand

* Adding more commentary to the readme
