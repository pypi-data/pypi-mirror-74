Description: # dotboy
        
        A Python script to help with dot file management
        
        ### Dependencies:
        
        GitPython
        
        ### Configuration:
        
        Configuration is done in a json stored in '~/.config/dotboy/config.json'
        
        An example configuration json is:
        
        {
          "repo_path": "~/projects/dot-files",
          "paths": [
            {
              "installed_path": "~",
              "repo_path": "",
              "files_to_copy": [
                ".tmux.conf",
                ".zshrc",
                ".zprofile",
                ".zpreztorc"
              ]
            },
            {
              "installed_path": "~/.config",
              "repo_path": ".config",
              "files_to_copy": [
                "nvim/init.vim",
                "nvim/coc-settings.json"
              ],
              "dirs_to_copy": [
                "alacritty",
                "sway",
                "waybar",
                "i3",
                "polybar",
                "picom",
                "dotboy"
              ]
            },
            {
              "installed_path": "/efi/EFI/refind",
              "repo_path": "refind",
              "files_to_copy": [
                "refind.conf"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        
        repo_path is the path to the repository that you want to store the dot files in.
        
        paths is a list of json objects, each corresponding to a path where dot files
        are stored on the system. Each object in paths needs two variables with two
        other optional variables.
        "installed_path" is the path to the installed location of the dot_files.
        "repo_path" is the path that you want the files stored within each host-folder
        inside of the repo.
        "files_to_copy" and "folders_to_copy" are both lists of files and folders,
        respectively to/from the installed path and repo path.
