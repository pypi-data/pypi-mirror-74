Description: # dotboy
        
        A Python script to help with dot file management.
        
        I originally started this because I got tired of manually copying dot files into
        my configuration repo any time I changed one and I didn't realize how many
        existing solutions there were. 
        
        Anyways, I kept working on it because it's a fun learning experience and I wanted 
        to add specific features that I could use for myself and decided to share it with 
        the world.
        
        ## Requirements:
        
        `python>=3.8`
        
        ## Dependencies:
        
        `GitPython` (handled by both pip and the aur packages)
        
        ## Installation:
        
        On Arch, you can use the [python-dotboy](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-dotboy/)
        or [python-dotboy-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-dotboy-git/) AUR packages.
        
        Otherwise, you can install `DotBoy` with pip via `pip install dotboy`.
        
        ## Configuration:
        
        Configuration is done in a json stored in '~/.config/dotboy/config.json'
        
        An example configuration json is:
        ```
        {
          "repo_url": "https://gitlab.com/bwbuhse/dotboy",
          "repo_path": "~/projects/dot-files",
          "paths": [
            {
              "installed_path": "~",
              "repo_path": "",
              "files_to_copy": [
                ".tmux.conf",
                ".zshrc",
                ".zprofile",
                ".zpreztorc"
              ]
            },
            {
              "installed_path": "~/.config",
              "repo_path": ".config",
              "files_to_copy": [
                "nvim/init.vim",
                "nvim/coc-settings.json"
              ],
              "dirs_to_copy": [
                "alacritty",
                "sway",
                "waybar",
                "i3",
                "polybar",
                "picom",
                "dotboy"
              ]
            },
            {
              "installed_path": "/efi/EFI/refind",
              "repo_path": "refind",
              "files_to_copy": [
                "refind.conf"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        `repo_url` is the url to your dot file repository. This field is optional. If the repository path exists on the local machine, then this field is ignored. Otherwise, if the path doesn't yet exist, dotboy will clone the repo at this URL to the `repo_path` location.
        
        `repo_path` is the path to the repository that you want to store the dot files in or where the repository already exists. This field is optional. If a path is supplied, the repository will be there, if not then the default path of `~/.dotboy` will be used.
        
        `paths` is a list of json objects, each corresponding to a path where dot files
        are stored on the system. Each object in paths needs two fields with two
        other optional variables.
        
          `installed_path` is the path to the installed location of the dot_files. This field is required for each element in paths.
        
          `repo_path` is the path that you want the files stored within each host-folder
          inside of the repo. This field is required for each element in paths.
          
          `files_to_copy` and `folders_to_copy` are both lists of files and folders,
          respectively to/from the installed path and repo path. These elements are optional, however the paths element will be useless without at least one.
