Description: # Feedly2Instapaper
        Feedly2Instapaper is a simple Python script that:connects to your Feedly and Instapaper accounts to add your "Saved for later"-entries as a new bookmark in Instapaper. If the bookmark was created , the corresponding entry in Feedly is removed.
        
        This script is meant to be used with a cron-job to automate the synchronisation.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install feedly2instapaper.
        I suggest installing it in an easily accessible location to be able to edit the settings file and point your cron-job to the script.
        ```bash
        pip3 install feedly2instapaper --target ./your-dir
        ```
