# GridSystem
The goal is to create an easy way for a Grid man to create and store grids for a karting final based on the heats for an event


Running with Python36 currently.

## Pull Project
Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/ocalla22/GridSystem.git

## Setup a virtual environment
1. We'll make a virtual environment for the project called myvenv. Use pyvenv or virtualenv. We'll use virtualenv

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myvenv

For Windows
source myvenv/Scripts/activate

For MacOS
source myvenv/bin/activate

in both systems we can deactivate the venv using the deactivate command
deactivate

2. install pyinstaller, we're using pyinstaller3.6 this makes packaging and generating the standalone executable easy.

pip install pyinstaller==3.6

## Package the Standalone Application
This won't work on MacOS. Pyinstaller, Tkinter and MacOS tend to disagree. For this reason its not so straight forward to make a standalone tkinter app for MacOS. Luckily the target market here is Windows users.
So the following instructions assume you've downloaded the project on Windows OS.

Run pyinstaller on the main application file. This will create the .spec file, and a build and dist folder. In the dist folder the .exe file to run the standalone application.
pyinstaller ./kartinggrids/hello.py

you can run find the standalone executable. Or distribute it for windows systems.
./dist/hello/hello.exe

You can test the application on MacOS by setting up the environment and running the main file.
./kartinggrid/hello.py, that should be enough to enhancement, but i strongly encourage packaging on windows only.
