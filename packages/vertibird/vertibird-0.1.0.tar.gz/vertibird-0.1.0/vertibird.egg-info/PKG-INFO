Description: 
        Vertibird is a dead-simple virtualization library based around direct access to
        QEMU. Because I couldn't be bothered to figure out how the hell the crappy
        libvirt C bindings work. I also couldn't be bothered to write a million lines
        of XML. Screw that.
        
        Currently only tested on x86_64, and probably only works on x86_64. Usage is
        also only possible on Linux, this library is NOT cross-platform. It would've
        taken an infinitely longer amount of time to write this for Windows, since it
        makes use of features such as named pipes.
