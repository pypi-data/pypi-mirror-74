A compliment of features to those provided by `Sphinx <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx>`_ that one found useful while documenting their source code.

API-Doc
  An alternative to the sphinx API doc function that tries to support an output structure that maps more closely to the code base and eases maintenance.
  This was written to be backwards compatible with the original implementation.
Epilog
  This provides a "universal" epilog for sphinx for authors working on multiple projects that need a common set of replacements.
  The intention is to provide a corresponding glossary module.

Background
----------

On occasion the features offered by Sphinx and its various extention packages do not provide all of the functionality necessary for authorisng a document.
Fortunately Sphinx is readily extended and one may implement the features one requires; after traversing the Sphinx and Docutils documentation.

Purpose
-------

This package hopes to collect such efforts into a common package.
Additionally, by documenting such efforts, the package hopes to assist other extention writers in contributing to its development.

Installation
------------

The package can be installed directly through `pip` ::

    pip install Sphinx-Nosejob

Usage
-----

Within ones Sphinx configuration file, ``source/conf.py``, include either all of the festures provided by ``Sphinx-Nosejob`` ::

    extensions = [...
        'sphinxcontrib.nosejob',
        ...]

Alternatively one may selectively include a subset of the provided features by explicitly specifying them ::

    extensions = [...
        'sphinxcontrib.nosejob.FEATURE',
        ...]

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at `Gitlab.io <https://manaikan.gitlab.io/sphinx-nosejob>`_.
