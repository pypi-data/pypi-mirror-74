# Calculating Materials Properties

## Structural relaxation

In order to obtain accurate results, the crystal structure should first be relaxed
using "tight" calculation settings including high force and energy convergence
criteria. Note, that this can often be expensive for very large structures.

    EDIFF = 1E-8

## Dielectric constants and polar-phonon frequency

Static and high-frequency dielectric constants and the "effective polar phonon
frequency" can be obtained using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). 
It is very important to first relax the structure using tight convergence 
settings, as described in the [structural relaxation section](#structural-relaxation).
Details on DFPT in VASP can be found on the [IBRION](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/IBRION)
and [LEPSILON](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/LEPSILON) documentation pages.

    ```python
    ADDGRID = True
    EDIFF = 1E-8
    PREC = Accurate
    NSW = 1
    IBRION = 8
    LEPSILON = True
    ```

Note, DFPT cannot be used with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. In these
cases the [LCALCEPS](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/LCALCEPS) flag should be
used in combination with `IBRION = 6`.

The dielectric constants and polar phonon frequency can be extracted from the
VASP outputs using the command:
```bash
amset phonon-frequency
```
The command should be run in a folder containing the `vasprun.xml` file output
from the DFPT calculation.

The effective phonon frequency is determined from the phonon frequencies 
$`\omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}`$ (where $`\nu`$ is a phonon branch and $`\mathbf{q}`$
is a phonon wave vector) and eigenvectors $`\mathbf{e}_{\kappa\nu}(\mathbf{q})`$
(where $`\kappa`$ is an atom in the unit cell). In order to capture scattering 
from the full phonon band structure in a single phonon frequency, each phonon 
mode is weighted by the dipole moment it produces according to
```math
w_{\nu} = \sum_\kappa \left [ \frac{1}{M_\kappa \omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}} \right]^{1/2}
\times \left[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{Z}_\kappa^* \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\kappa\nu}(\mathbf{q}) \right ]
```
where $`\mathbf{Z}_\kappa^*`$ is the Born effective charge.
This naturally suppresses the contributions from transverse-optical and acoustic
modes in the same manner as the [more general formalism](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.176401) 
for computing Fr√∂lich based electron-phonon coupling.

The weight is calculated only for $`\Gamma`$-point phonon frequencies and 
averaged over the full unit sphere to capture both the polar divergence 
at $`\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0`$ and any anisotropy in the dipole moments.
The effective phonon frequency is calculated as the weighted sum over all 
$`\Gamma`$-point phonon modes according to
```math
\omega_\mathrm{po} = \frac{\omega_{\Gamma\nu} w_{\nu}}{\sum_{\nu} w_\nu}.
```

## Elastic constants

Elastic constants can be calculated using finite differences in VASP.
It is very important to first relax the structure using tight convergence 
settings, as described in the [structural relaxation section](#structural-relaxation).
Details on the finite difference approach in VASP can be found on the [IBRION](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/IBRION)
documentation page.
